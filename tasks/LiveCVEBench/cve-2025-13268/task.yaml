  Our team is using dataCompare to manage database connections for data comparison tasks.
  We've noticed that the database connection test feature accepts any connection string
  without validation.

  When testing database connections through the web interface at `/system/dbconfig/testConnection`,
  users can enter arbitrary JDBC URL parameters. We're concerned that this could be exploited
  by malicious users who have valid login credentials.

  The connection test feature takes the following parameters:
  - connectName: A name for the connection
  - type: Database type (MySQL, Hive, Doris, etc.)
  - url: The JDBC connection URL
  - userName: Database username
  - pwd: Database password

  The application should validate the JDBC URL and reject connection strings that contain
  driver-specific parameters that could cause unintended side effects. The URL validation
  should be case-insensitive.

  Default credentials: admin/admin123
