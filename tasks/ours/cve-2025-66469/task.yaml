instruction: |-
  This application is a web-based UI demo built with NiceGUI, a Python framework for
  creating graphical interfaces in the browser. It allows users to customize the
  appearance of buttons by passing a color value through a URL query parameter.

  When users access the application with certain special characters in the color
  parameter (e.g., containing HTML-like syntax such as angle brackets or closing
  tags), the page renders incorrectly. Instead of displaying the styled button,
  parts of the user input appear as raw HTML elements on the page, and in some
  cases, the browser executes unexpected JavaScript code embedded in the URL.

  For example, accessing the page with a URL like:
  `/?color=red;}</style><img src=x onerror=console.log('test')><style>`
  causes an image element to appear and JavaScript to execute, rather than just
  applying a red background color to the button.

  We expect the application to safely handle any user-provided color values,
  displaying the styled button correctly regardless of what characters are in
  the input. Special characters should be treated as literal text and should
  never be interpreted as HTML or JavaScript.
