# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Argo CD is a declarative GitOps tool for continuous delivery to Kubernetes.
  
  I enabled the apps-in-any-namespace feature, set application.namespaces to a comma-delimited list of glob patterns (e.g., argocd-*), and run the Application controller with sharding.
  
  I found that a user can get an Application in a non-matching namespace (e.g., other) reconciled after an update when an AppProject permits that namespace, meaning the allowed namespace patterns are not enforced during reconciliation under sharding.
  
  Please fix this so the Application controller consistently enforces application.namespaces during reconciliation in sharded setups, preventing deployments outside the configured namespaces.
