instruction: |-
  When extracting a tarball that contains a hardlink pointing to an existing file on the system, followed by a regular file with the same name as the hardlink, the extraction overwrites the original file's content unexpectedly. For example, if the tar contains a hardlink to /etc/config and then a file entry with the same name, extracting this tar modifies /etc/config. The extraction should not allow hardlinks to reference files outside the extraction directory.
