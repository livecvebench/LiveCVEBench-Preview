  This is a Nuxt.js application that uses the MDC (Markdown Components) module to render
  user-submitted markdown content. Users can write markdown that gets converted to HTML
  and displayed on the site.

  We've implemented security measures to block <script> tags from executing in the rendered
  markdown - they get converted to <pre> tags safely. However, users have reported that
  certain HTML elements are still being rendered literally in the output when they shouldn't be.

  Specifically, when a markdown document contains a <base href="..."> tag, it appears to be
  rendered in the DOM without any sanitization. This is causing issues because the <base>
  element affects how all relative URLs on the page are resolved, which breaks navigation
  and resource loading when malicious content is submitted.

  For example, if a user submits markdown containing:
    <base href="https://some-other-domain.com">

  The browser will resolve all relative URLs (like /images/logo.png or /api/data) relative
  to that external domain instead of our site, breaking the page functionality.

  We expect the application to handle <base> tags the same way it handles <script> tags -
  by converting them to safe <pre> elements that display the raw HTML rather than executing it.

  The relevant component is MDCRenderer.vue in the @nuxtjs/mdc package. Please fix the
  markdown renderer to properly sanitize <base> tags alongside <script> tags.
