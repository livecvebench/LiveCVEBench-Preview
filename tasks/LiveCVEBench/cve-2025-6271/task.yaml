  This application is swftools' wav2swf utility, which converts WAV audio files
  to SWF (Flash) format.

  I'm trying to convert some WAV files I received from a third party, but the
  application crashes unexpectedly. When I run wav2swf on certain WAV files,
  instead of either converting them successfully or showing an error message,
  the program terminates with a segmentation fault or memory access error.

  Here's an example of what happens:

  $ ./wav2swf -o output.swf problematic_file.wav
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)

  The files that cause the crash seem to have unusual header values or were
  possibly corrupted during transfer. Some of the crashes happen with files
  that have unconventional audio parameters.

  I would expect the tool to either convert valid files successfully or
  gracefully reject invalid/corrupted files with an appropriate error message.
  Instead, it just crashes without any explanation.

  Could you investigate why the tool crashes on these files and add proper
  validation to handle malformed input gracefully?
