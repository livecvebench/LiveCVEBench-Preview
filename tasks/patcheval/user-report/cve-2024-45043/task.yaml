# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  The OpenTelemetry Collector awsfirehosereceiver ingests AWS Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream messages and parses records (e.g., CloudWatch metrics) based on the configured record type.
  
  I deployed this receiver, exposed the HTTP endpoint for Firehose, and configured it to require the X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key header.
  
  I found that the endpoint still accepts requests without this header and ingests the metrics, enabling unauthenticated writes that could conceal other activity.
  
  Please fix the receiver to enforce the configured access key and reject any request that is missing the required header.
