instruction: |-
  This is a hotel booking system with a REST API for managing orders. The system allows
  users to view their booking orders through the order listing endpoint.

  Users are reporting that when they enter certain phone number formats with special
  characters (like quotes or dashes), the order listing API behaves unexpectedly. In some
  cases, it returns orders belonging to other users, and in other cases it shows database
  errors or hangs.

  For example, when a user accidentally enters their phone number with a trailing quote
  (e.g., "15757118111'"), the system either crashes or returns incorrect data instead of
  properly rejecting the malformed input.

  The order list API should validate that the telephone parameter contains exactly 11
  digits (valid Chinese phone number format) and reject any input that doesn't match this
  format with an appropriate error message. Normal phone numbers like "15757118111" should
  continue to work correctly.

  The endpoint in question is /controller/api/orderList.php.
