  WeGIA is a web-based management system for charitable institutions that includes
  modules for inventory control, personnel management, and other administrative
  functions.

  When adding a new product through the inventory management module, requests with
  certain special characters in the product description field cause unexpected
  server delays. For example, submitting a product with a description containing
  single quotes followed by specific patterns (like "Test' AND SLEEP(3) AND '1'='1")
  causes the server to hang for several seconds before responding.

  Additionally, when descriptions contain certain syntax, database error messages
  are sometimes exposed in the response, revealing internal structure information.

  The expected behavior is that product descriptions should be processed safely
  regardless of what characters they contain, and the application should respond
  promptly without exposing internal error details.
