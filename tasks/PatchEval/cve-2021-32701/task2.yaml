instruction: |-
  The OAuth2 introspection authenticator does not properly validate token scopes when using cached introspection results. A token that was successfully validated for an endpoint requiring one scope can incorrectly pass validation for a subsequent request to an endpoint requiring a different scope, if the cached result hasn't expired yet. The cache should include scope information in its validation.
