  I'm using this video hosting platform and noticed something concerning with 
  the playlist feature.
  
  When I try to upload a cover image for my playlist, the upload form seems to 
  accept any file type, not just images. I accidentally selected a text file 
  once and it uploaded successfully without any error.
  
  Steps to reproduce:
  1. Log in as a regular user
  2. Go to Manage Playlists and edit any playlist
  3. Try to upload a non-image file (like a .txt or .html file) as the cover
  4. The upload succeeds without validation
  
  The file even gets saved with its original extension, which seems wrong for 
  a "cover image" upload feature.
  
  Expected behavior:
  - Only accept valid image files (JPEG, PNG, GIF)
  - Reject other file types with a clear error message
  - OR just disable the upload feature if it's not working properly
  
  This feels like it could be a security problem since users might be able to 
  upload malicious files through this feature.
