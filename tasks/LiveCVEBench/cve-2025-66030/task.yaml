  This is the node-forge library, a JavaScript implementation of TLS and various
  cryptographic utilities including ASN.1 parsing.

  When processing ASN.1 Object Identifiers (OIDs) with very large arc values
  (numbers between the dots, e.g., in "1.2.840.113549" the arcs are 1, 2, 840,
  and 113549), the OID encoding/decoding functions produce incorrect results.

  Specifically:
  1. When converting an OID string to DER format using `oidToDer()`, arc values
     larger than 32 bits (> 4294967295) should be rejected but are silently
     processed incorrectly.

  2. When converting DER-encoded data back to an OID string using `derToOid()`,
     arc values larger than 53 bits (> 9007199254740991, JavaScript's
     MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) cause silent value corruption due to integer handling
     issues.

  For example, an OID arc value that should be "4294967297" might be decoded as
  a completely different number, or an OID with arcs exceeding safe integer
  limits gets silently truncated.

  The library should properly validate OID arc values and throw clear error
  messages when values exceed the supported range, rather than silently
  producing incorrect results.
