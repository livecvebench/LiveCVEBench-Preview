  This application is a server-side rendering (SSR) demo built with Solid.js. It renders
  user-provided content through various Solid.js components like Suspense and ErrorBoundary.

  When user input containing special characters is passed to the server via query parameters
  (e.g., /?text=<some-input>), the HTML characters are not being properly encoded in the
  server response. For example, if a user provides input like "<b>hello</b>", the raw HTML
  tags appear in the response instead of being converted to display as literal text
  (e.g., "&lt;b&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt;").

  This affects content rendered through:
  - Suspense components (both fallback content and resolved async content)
  - ErrorBoundary components
  - JSX fragments containing dynamic data from createResource()

  The server output should properly encode HTML special characters (< to &lt;, & to &amp;)
  so that user-provided content displays as text rather than being interpreted as HTML markup.
