  WeGIA is an open source Web Manager for Institutions focused on Portuguese
  language users. This task involves the password configuration page that displays
  employee names in a dropdown menu.

  The page `/WeGIA/html/geral/configurar_senhas.php` retrieves employee names and
  positions from the database and displays them in a `<select>` dropdown. However,
  when employee records contain special characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, or quotes,
  the page renders incorrectly, and the dropdown options become malformed or break
  the HTML structure entirely.

  For example, if an employee's name is stored as `John O'Brien & Associates` or
  `<Team Lead>`, the dropdown displays incorrectly or causes rendering issues in
  the browser. In some cases, certain characters in names cause unexpected behavior
  when the page loads.

  The expected behavior is that all employee names should display correctly in the
  dropdown regardless of what special characters they contain. The application
  should properly encode output so that names with special characters render as
  visible text rather than being interpreted as HTML markup.
