# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  h11 is a Python library that implements HTTP/1.1.
  
  I use h11 to process HTTP requests in a Python service that runs behind a reverse proxy.
  
  I found that certain chunked transfer requests with unusual line terminators are handled in a way that enables request smuggling across the proxy path.
  
  Please address this so chunked message bodies are parsed strictly and cannot be used to smuggle requests.
