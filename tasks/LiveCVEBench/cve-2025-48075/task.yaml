instruction: |-
  This is a Fiber web framework application that provides a form data parsing service.
  The application accepts POST requests with nested form fields using bracket notation
  (e.g., `nested-content[0].value=First`, `nested-content[1].value=Second`).

  Users are reporting that the server crashes unexpectedly when processing certain form
  submissions. After sending a form request, the server becomes completely unresponsive
  and subsequent requests fail with "connection refused" errors. The server logs show:

      panic: reflect: slice index out of range

  Investigating further, the crash appears to happen during form data parsing when
  processing nested array fields. The application should handle all form submissions
  gracefully - malformed input should result in an appropriate error response (e.g.,
  HTTP 422) rather than crashing the entire server.

  We expect the form parser to validate input properly and return meaningful error
  messages for invalid data, without causing the server to become unavailable.
