  CubeCart is an open-source e-commerce platform built with PHP. When a user changes
  their password through the profile settings, their current session remains active
  and they continue to stay logged in.

  The issue becomes problematic in scenarios involving multiple concurrent sessions.
  For example, if a user is logged in from two different browsers or devices and
  changes their password from one of them, the other session remains fully active
  and can still access the account. This also applies to admin accounts in the
  admin panel.

  We expect that when a user changes their password:
  1. Their current session should be terminated and they should be redirected to the login page
  2. All other active sessions for that user should also become invalid
  3. The user should see a message indicating they need to log in with their new password

  This behavior should apply to both regular customer accounts (via the profile page)
  and admin accounts (via admin panel settings).
