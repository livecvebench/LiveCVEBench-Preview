# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  SFTPGo is a configurable server for SFTP, HTTP/S, FTP/S, and WebDAV with storage backends like S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob, and it can trigger scripts or applications on events via an EventManager.
  
  I allowed an administrator to configure event-driven scripts from the WebAdmin UI.
  
  They were able to run system commands and access the underlying OS/container with the same permissions as the SFTPGo process user, which was unexpected for a WebAdmin-only role.
  
  Please fix this so granting script execution permissions in the WebAdmin UI does not effectively provide shell access to the host, and ensure command execution is appropriately restricted.
