  ClipBucket V5 is a video sharing platform that allows users to upload and share videos.
  The application supports theme/template customization through a web interface.

  We've discovered that unauthenticated visitors can somehow modify the site's template
  configuration, which causes the website to break and pages fail to render properly.

  Your task is to find how this is possible and fix it so that only authenticated
  administrators can modify template settings.
