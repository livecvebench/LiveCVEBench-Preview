  This is a PHP-based Voting System application with an admin panel for managing
  elections, candidates, and voters. Administrators can add, edit, and view
  candidate information including their names and platform statements.

  Users have reported that when candidate information containing special characters
  (e.g., angle brackets, ampersands, or quotes) is entered and saved, the
  displayed content on the candidates list page appears broken or causes
  unexpected browser behavior. In some cases, the admin panel becomes unusable
  after entering certain character combinations in candidate fields.

  For example, when entering candidate data like:
  - Firstname: John <Test>
  - Platform: Support for R&D programs

  The page either displays incorrectly, shows raw HTML-like content, or executes
  unintended scripts in the browser.

  The expected behavior is that all user-provided candidate data (firstname,
  lastname, platform text) should be displayed exactly as entered, without
  causing display issues or browser script execution. Special characters should
  appear literally on the page.

  The admin panel is accessible at /votesystem/admin/ with credentials:
  - Username: codeprojects
  - Password: password

  Focus your investigation on how candidate data is stored and displayed in
  the admin/candidates.php file and related JavaScript code.
