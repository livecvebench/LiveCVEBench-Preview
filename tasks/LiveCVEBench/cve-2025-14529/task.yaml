  This is a Retro Basketball Shoes Online Store application built with PHP and MySQL.
  The admin panel at /admin/ allows store managers to manage product inventory.

  When updating stock quantities via the "Stock In" or "Stock Out" buttons on the
  Nike products page (/admin/admin_running.php), the product ID parameter is not
  being validated properly. If a user submits a malformed product ID containing
  special characters (such as quotes or SQL syntax), the application exhibits
  unexpected behavior including:

  - Database queries timing out or taking unusually long to complete
  - Unexpected error messages being exposed to users
  - Stock quantities being modified incorrectly or for unintended products

  For example, submitting a stock update with a product ID like "68129' AND 1=1-- "
  instead of just "68129" causes the application to behave abnormally rather than
  rejecting the invalid input.

  The expected behavior is that the application should properly validate and
  sanitize the product ID parameter before using it in database operations,
  ensuring that only valid numeric product IDs are accepted.
