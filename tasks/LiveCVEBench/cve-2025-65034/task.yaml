  I'm using Rallly (the open-source scheduling tool) and noticed some strange behavior.

  When I create a poll and finalize it by booking a date, other users who are logged in
  can somehow reopen my poll! They just need to know my poll ID (which is visible in the
  URL). When they reopen it, my scheduled event gets deleted - super frustrating!

  I tested a few other operations and found the same problem:
  - Other users can pause my active polls
  - They can resume my paused polls
  - They can subscribe to watch my polls for notifications

  This shouldn't be possible. Only I (the poll owner) or team members in my workspace
  should be able to manage my polls. Right now it seems like the system only checks that
  someone is logged in, but doesn't verify they actually own the poll or are part of the
  same workspace.

  Please fix this so unauthorized users get blocked with a proper error message when they
  try to modify polls they don't have access to.
