  This application is a wiki system written in PHP that allows collaborative
  content editing with markdown-style formatting support.

  When users include special characters like angle brackets (< and >) in certain
  markdown formatting patterns, the content is rendered incorrectly in the browser.
  For example, entering `# Test <example>` as a heading causes the text between
  angle brackets to be interpreted as HTML rather than displayed literally.
  Similarly, italic text using underscores like `_some <text> here_` or asterisks
  like `*some <text> here*` exhibits the same problem.

  This creates display issues where content between angle brackets disappears
  or causes the page layout to break. The expected behavior is that special
  characters within markdown formatting should be properly escaped and displayed
  as literal text.

  The wiki formatter (formatters/wakka.php) needs to properly escape user-provided
  content when processing markdown titles and italic formatting.
