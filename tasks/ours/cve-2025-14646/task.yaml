  This is a School File Management System - a PHP web application that allows
  administrators to manage student records and their associated files. Students
  can log in to view and upload their personal files.

  We've noticed unexpected behavior in the student deletion functionality located
  in the admin panel. When attempting to delete a student record by submitting
  certain special characters in the student ID field (e.g., single quotes,
  dashes, or other non-numeric characters), the application exhibits the
  following issues:

  1. The delete endpoint at /admin/delete_student.php accepts arbitrary text
     input for the student ID parameter instead of validating it as a number.

  2. When special characters are included, the application either hangs for
     an extended period, produces database error messages revealing internal
     query structure, or behaves inconsistently compared to normal numeric input.

  3. In some cases, error messages like "You have an error in your SQL syntax"
     are displayed to the user.

  The expected behavior is:
  - The student ID should be validated as a positive integer before use
  - Invalid input should be rejected gracefully without exposing internal errors
  - The database operations should use parameterized queries to handle input safely
  - The application should respond consistently regardless of input format

  Please fix the input handling in /admin/delete_student.php to properly validate
  and sanitize the stud_id parameter before using it in database operations.
