  I'm using this project management system which recently added AI integration
  features. There's a configuration page where you can set up AI model connections.
  
  When I was testing the "Test Connection" button, I noticed something strange.
  I accidentally typed a wrong URL pointing to an internal service, and the
  server actually tried to connect to it! I could see responses from internal
  services that shouldn't be accessible from outside.
  
  For example, when I put in a URL pointing to other services on our internal
  network, the server made the request and showed me what came back. This seems
  like it could be used to scan internal services or access things that should
  be protected.
  
  Expected behavior:
  - The connection test should only allow connections to legitimate external
    AI service providers
  - Internal addresses and localhost should be blocked
  - Or the feature should be removed if it's not secure
