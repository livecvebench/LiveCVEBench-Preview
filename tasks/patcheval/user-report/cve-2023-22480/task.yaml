# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  KubeOperator is an open-source Kubernetes distribution that helps enterprises plan, deploy, and operate production-grade clusters.
  
  I deployed it to manage our clusters and connected our internal automation to its API with authentication and access controls configured.
  
  I found that some API endpoints still respond to unauthorized requests and leak sensitive cluster information, and in testing this behavior could enable a cluster takeover under certain conditions.
  
  Please fix the API authorization so endpoints reject unauthorized requests and do not expose sensitive data.
