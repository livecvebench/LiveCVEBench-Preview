  This is a PHP-based kindergarten management system that provides functionality for
  managing student records, class assignments, and parent information.

  Users have reported that the student archive search page (stu_list.php) behaves
  unexpectedly when certain search terms containing special characters are used.

  When searching with values containing apostrophes or other punctuation in the
  gender (sex), ethnicity (nation), or keywords fields, the application either:
  - Returns unexpected results (too many or too few records)
  - Causes database errors
  - In some cases, the page takes an unusually long time to respond (several seconds
    for simple searches)

  For example, searching with gender value "女'" (female with an apostrophe) causes
  the page to malfunction. Similar issues occur with the nation and keywords fields.

  The expected behavior is that the application should handle any user input safely
  and return only matching records, or display an appropriate message if no records
  match the search criteria. Special characters in search terms should be treated
  as literal characters, not as part of database commands.

  Please investigate the search functionality in stu_list.php and fix the input
  handling to ensure the application processes all search inputs safely.
