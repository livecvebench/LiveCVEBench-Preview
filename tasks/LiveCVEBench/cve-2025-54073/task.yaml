  This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides package
  documentation lookup for Go, Python, NPM, Rust, and Swift.

  When looking up documentation for packages with special characters in
  their names, unexpected behavior occurs. For example:

  - Querying package name `fmt; touch /tmp/test` creates a file on the server
  - Package names with `$(command)` or backticks cause system commands to run
  - Names containing `|` or `&&` result in unexpected system behavior

  Instead of returning validation errors for invalid package names, the
  application appears to pass them directly to system commands.

  Expected behavior:
  - Package names should be validated for allowed characters only
  - Special shell characters should be rejected with a validation error
  - Invalid names should not cause any filesystem or system side effects
