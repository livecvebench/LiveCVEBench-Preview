instruction: |-
  In Helm greater than or equal to 3.0.0 and less than 3.2.4, a path traversal attack is possible when installing Helm plugins from a tar archive over HTTP. It is possible for a malicious plugin author to inject a relative path into a plugin archive, and copy a file outside of the intended directory. This has been fixed in 3.2.4.
  Vulnerability Location:
    File path:pkg/plugin/installer/http_installer.go, start line:154, end line:198
