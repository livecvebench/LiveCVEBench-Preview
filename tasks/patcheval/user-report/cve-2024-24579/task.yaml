# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  stereoscope is a Go library for processing container images and simulating a squash filesystem.
  
  I used github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/file.UntarToDirectory(), github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/image/oci.TarballImageProvider, and github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/image.Image.Read() to unarchive an OCI tar archive into a temporary directory.
  
  While unarchiving, files were written to paths outside of that temporary directory.
  
  Please fix this so these APIs only write within the specified directory and cannot escape it.
