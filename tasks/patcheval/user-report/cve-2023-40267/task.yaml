# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  GitPython is a Python library for interacting with Git repositories from Python, including cloning.
  
  I use clone and clone_from in my application where certain options can be provided.
  
  I found that these calls accept insecure non-multi options and pass them through to the clone operation.
  
  Please update clone and clone_from to block these insecure options so they cannot be applied.
