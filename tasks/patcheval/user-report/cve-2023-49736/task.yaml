# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Apache Superset is an open-source platform for data exploration, visualization, and dashboarding that runs SQL queries against connected databases.
  
  I built dashboards using SQL templates that call the where_in JINJA macro to let users filter datasets via parameters.
  
  I observed that with carefully crafted input, a user can inject SQL through this macro and cause the query to run unintended statements.
  
  Please fix this so the where_in macro is safe to use with user-provided parameters and cannot be used for SQL injection.
