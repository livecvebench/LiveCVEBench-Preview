instruction: |-
  Access to the password file is not properly restricted. The file is served by the static file handler in the root directory, and the rule to deny access to this file can be bypassed. Additionally, the password hash is used as the cookie secret, which allows anyone with access to the hash to generate valid authentication cookies. The password file should be properly protected and the cookie secret should be separate from the password hash.
