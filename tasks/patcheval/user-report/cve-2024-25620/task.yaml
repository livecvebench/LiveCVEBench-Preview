# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Helm is a tool for managing Charts, which are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.
  
  I saved a chart through the Helm client and SDK whose name in its Chart.yaml included a relative path change.
  
  The chart was written outside its expected directory, and validation and linting did not flag the path change.
  
  Please fix this so saving a chart always stays within its expected directory and the tooling reports any path changes in chart names, including in dependencies.
