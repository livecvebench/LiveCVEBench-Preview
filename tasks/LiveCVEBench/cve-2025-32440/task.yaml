  NetAlertX is an open-source network presence scanner and alert framework.

  Users report that even with password protection enabled in the configuration,
  certain administrative functions can still be triggered without authentication.

  Specifically, when sending a POST request to the login page (/index.php) with
  a "function" parameter (e.g., function=savesettings), the application processes
  the request and executes the corresponding function, bypassing the authentication
  check entirely. This allows unauthenticated users to modify application settings,
  including disabling password protection.

  The expected behavior is that the login page should ONLY handle login functionality.
  Administrative functions like saving settings should never be accessible without
  proper authentication, regardless of which URL endpoint is accessed.

  The root cause appears to be related to PHP file include ordering - the login page
  is loading server initialization code that exposes administrative functions before
  authentication is enforced.
