instruction: |-
  When a client connection is not authorized, the MQTT broker is still publishing the Last Will and Testament (LWT) message to the channel. This means that even when a client fails authorization, their LWT message gets broadcast to other subscribers. The broker should not publish LWT messages for clients that were not properly authorized.
