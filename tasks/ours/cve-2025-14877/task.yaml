  I'm an administrator for the Supplier Management System. I use the "Add Retailer"
  page (`/admin/add_retailer.php`) to onboard new retailers.

  I noticed some strange behavior when selecting the "Area Code". If I manipulate
  the request to send special characters in the `cmbAreaCode` field, the server
  takes a long time to respond.

  For example, if I send:
  `cmbAreaCode=1' AND (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))x) AND '1'='1`

  The request hangs for about 5 seconds before completing. This suggests that
  the Area Code input is being concatenated directly into an SQL `INSERT` statement
  without proper sanitization.

  Expected behavior:
  - The `cmbAreaCode` field should be properly validated and sanitized.
  - Malicious SQL payloads should be rejected or treated as literal strings.
  - The application should not execute injected SQL commands like `SLEEP()`.
  - Normal functionality (adding valid retailers) should remain unaffected.
