  This application is CMSimple_XH, a content management system that provides a web-based
  interface for creating and managing website content.

  Users have reported that when visiting certain URLs with special characters in the path
  segment (after index.php), those characters appear unmodified in the page HTML source.
  For example, visiting a URL like:

    /index.php/some-path"><test>example

  Results in the characters "><test> appearing raw in several places in the generated HTML,
  including the search form action attribute and various navigation links. Characters like
  angle brackets (< >) and quotes (") should be properly escaped as HTML entities (&lt;,
  &gt;, &quot;) when output in HTML context.

  This affects multiple locations in the page output:
  - The search form action attribute
  - Menu links (sitemap, mailform, login)
  - Navigation breadcrumbs
  - Various other href attributes

  The expected behavior is that any special characters from the URL path should be
  properly HTML-encoded before being inserted into HTML attributes to ensure valid
  markup and prevent malformed HTML output.
