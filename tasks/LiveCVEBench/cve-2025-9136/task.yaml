  I'm using a file stream library that provides cross-platform file I/O operations.
  
  When I try to parse a configuration file using the scanf-like function, the 
  application behaves strangely if the file contains unexpected data. For example,
  when I have a config file with "abc" where I expected a number, instead of 
  gracefully handling the mismatch, the file position jumps to a random location.
  
  Sometimes the application crashes or hangs when processing files with mismatched
  format specifiers. Memory sanitizers report out-of-bounds read errors.
  
  Steps to reproduce:
  1. Create a file containing non-numeric text like "abc"
  2. Try to read it using scanf with "%d" format
  3. Observe that the file position becomes corrupted
  
  Expected: The function should return 0 (no match) and leave the file position
  at the start of the unmatched content.
  
  Actual: File position jumps to arbitrary location, potential memory errors.
