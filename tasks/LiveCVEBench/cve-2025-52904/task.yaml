  We're using FileBrowser as our team's file sharing solution. I noticed something
  concerning - I set up different directories for each team member so they can only
  see their own files, but they seem to be able to read each other's files when using
  the shell command feature.

  For example, I have Alice assigned to "/srv/alice/" and Bob to "/srv/bob/". When Alice
  uses the shell to run "cat /srv/bob/secrets.txt", she can actually see Bob's file
  contents! But when she browses through the web UI, she correctly only sees her own
  folder.

  This is a security issue for us. Can you disable the command runner feature by default?
  It should require administrators to explicitly turn it on if they want to use it,
  since most of our users don't need it anyway.

  The app has a "--disable-exec" flag but it defaults to false (enabled). We need it
  to default to true (disabled) so new deployments are secure out of the box.
