# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Hoverfly is a lightweight service virtualization, API simulation, and API mocking tool for developers and testers.
  
  I used the /api/v2/simulation POST handler to create simulation views from a user-specified file path in my Hoverfly instance.
  
  I found that if the supplied path includes ../ segments, the handler reads files outside the configured response body files directory, enabling arbitrary file reads from the server even though absolute paths are blocked.
  
  Please fix this so the endpoint only reads files within the intended base directory and rejects requests that attempt to escape it.
