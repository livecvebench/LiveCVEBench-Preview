Currently, this endpoint accepts requests without requiring\nany authentication.\n\nWhen sending a POST request to `/api/v1/validate/code` with a JSON body\ncontaining `{\"code\": \"def example(): pass\"}`, the server returns a 200 response\nwith validation results, even though no authentication credentials were\nprovided.\n\nAccording to the application's security model, all code-related endpoints\nshould require user authentication to prevent unauthorized access. Other\nsimilar endpoints in the API correctly require authentication before\nprocessing requests.\n\nPlease add authentication to the `/api/v1/validate/code` endpoint so that\nunauthenticated requests are rejected with a 401 Unauthorized response.",
