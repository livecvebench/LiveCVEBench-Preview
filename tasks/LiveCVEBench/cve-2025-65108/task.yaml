  This application is md-to-pdf, a CLI tool and Node.js library for converting Markdown
  files to PDF using headless Chrome.

  I'm concerned about security when converting user-uploaded Markdown files. When I process
  Markdown files that contain YAML-style front-matter blocks, the application seems to
  handle them correctly. However, I noticed that some front-matter formats might allow
  code to be executed during the conversion process.

  For example, when testing with various front-matter delimiters, I found that certain
  configurations allow the JavaScript code inside front-matter to actually run on my
  server. This is a problem because users could upload malicious Markdown that executes
  arbitrary code.

  I believe the application has some protection against this, but it doesn't seem to be
  working correctly for all cases. The protection appears incomplete - some front-matter
  formats are blocked while others with similar functionality are not.

  Users expect that the converter should safely process Markdown without executing
  arbitrary code from front-matter blocks, regardless of which specific delimiter
  format is used.
