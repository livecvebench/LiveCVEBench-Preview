# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  GitHub CLI is the official command-line tool for interacting with GitHub repositories and GitHub Actions, including downloading workflow artifacts.
  
  I used gh run download to fetch a workflow artifact and set a destination using the --dir flag.
  
  When the artifact was named "..", the files were extracted one directory above the specified --dir and overwrote files outside the intended location.
  
  Please fix gh run download so artifact downloads always stay within the specified --dir and cannot create or overwrite files outside it.
