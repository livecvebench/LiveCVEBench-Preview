# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  GitPython is a Python library for interacting with Git repositories.
  
  I use it to resolve git references in my app, where ref names can come from user input.
  
  When users supply path-like names, GitPython attempts to read files outside the repository’s .git directory. It doesn’t return the file contents, but these reads can cause the program to hang or crash.
  
  Please fix this so resolving refs never touches files outside .git, and user-supplied names cannot cause denial-of-service.
