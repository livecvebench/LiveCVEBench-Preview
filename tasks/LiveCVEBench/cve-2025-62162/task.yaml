  This application provides a CEL (Common Expression Language) parser and evaluator,
  commonly used for policy evaluation and expression filtering in various services.

  When parsing certain malformed CEL expressions, the application crashes instead of
  returning a parse error. For example:
  - Incomplete function calls with missing closing parenthesis: `x(1,`
  - Empty parentheses in expressions: `1 + ()`
  - Expressions with just operators: `/` or `.`
  - Invalid identifier prefixes: `@foo`
  - Trailing commas in function calls: `x(1,)`

  When any of these malformed expressions are passed to the parser, the process
  terminates with an error message like:
  ```
  internal error: entered unreachable code: should have been properly implemented by generated context when reachable
  ```

  We expect the parser to handle malformed input gracefully by returning parse errors
  instead of crashing the process. The application should remain stable even when
  processing invalid or syntactically incorrect expressions.
