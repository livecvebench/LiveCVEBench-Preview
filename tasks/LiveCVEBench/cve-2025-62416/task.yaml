  This is Bagisto, an open-source Laravel eCommerce platform. The admin panel
  allows creating and editing products, including product descriptions through
  a rich text editor.

  We discovered an issue where certain special character sequences in product
  descriptions cause unexpected behavior when viewing the product page on the
  storefront. Instead of displaying text literally as entered, some character
  patterns appear to be processed by the server before rendering.

  For example:
  - When a product description contains text like "Price: {{7*7}}" (perhaps
    documenting some template syntax), the storefront displays "Price: 49"
    instead of the literal text.
  - Text patterns starting with "@" followed by certain keywords get processed
    or removed entirely rather than displayed verbatim.

  This is problematic because:
  1. Product descriptions containing technical documentation or code examples
     display incorrectly
  2. Certain character sequences could potentially be processed in unintended ways
  3. Users cannot reliably include all types of text content in descriptions

  The expected behavior is that all text entered in the product description
  should be displayed exactly as entered, without any server-side processing
  or interpretation of special character patterns.

  The issue appears to be in how the product description is rendered on the
  storefront product view page.
