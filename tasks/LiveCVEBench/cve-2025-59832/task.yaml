  This application is Horilla, an open-source HR Management System built with Django.
  It includes a help desk module where employees can create support tickets and add
  comments.

  Users have reported that when certain formatted content is entered in ticket
  comments and later viewed by other users (particularly administrators), the page
  behaves unexpectedly. For example, content that appears to be HTML markup in
  comments causes the browser to execute unintended actions when the ticket is
  viewed.

  Expected behavior: The application should prevent potentially dangerous content
  (like script tags or event handlers) from being saved in comments. Safe HTML
  formatting (like bold, italic, paragraphs) should still be allowed.
