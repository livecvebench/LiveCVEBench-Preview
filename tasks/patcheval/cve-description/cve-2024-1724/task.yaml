# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  In snapd versions prior to 2.62, when using AppArmor for enforcement of  
  sandbox permissions, snapd failed to restrict writes to the $HOME/bin 
  path. In Ubuntu, when this path exists, it is automatically added to 
  the users PATH. An attacker who could convince a user to install a 
  malicious snap which used the 'home' plug could use this vulnerability 
  to install arbitrary scripts into the users PATH which may then be run 
  by the user outside of the expected snap sandbox and hence allow them 
  to escape confinement.
