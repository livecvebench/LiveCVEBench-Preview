  This is a WordPress plugin that captures UTM tracking parameters from URLs
  and displays them on pages using shortcodes like [utm_source], [utm_medium],
  [utm_campaign], etc.

  When certain URL parameters are passed to pages containing these shortcodes,
  the displayed values can contain unescaped HTML characters. For example, if a
  user visits a page with utm_source parameter containing special characters like
  angle brackets or quotes, these characters appear in the rendered HTML without
  being properly encoded.

  This causes issues when the parameter values contain characters that should be
  displayed as text but instead get interpreted as HTML markup. The expected
  behavior is that all special characters in UTM parameter values should be
  displayed as literal text, not as HTML elements.

  The shortcode output handlers in the main plugin file need to properly escape
  their output values before returning them to WordPress for display.
