# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  chuanhuchatgpt is a web application that provides a chat interface for ChatGPT and manages runtime configuration.
  
  I deployed the app on a server and used the configuration features during normal operation.
  
  I found that critical configuration files can be overwritten without authorization, which allows changes to system behavior or security settings and can lead to service disruption.
  
  Please fix this by protecting configuration files from unauthorized writes and preventing denial-of-service caused by tampering with them.
