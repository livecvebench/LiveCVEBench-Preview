  This application is zuluCrypt, a tool for creating and managing encrypted volumes.
  It includes a helper component called zuluPolkit that handles privileged operations
  through PolicyKit integration.

  Users have reported an authorization issue with the zuluPolkit component. When
  non-administrative users authenticate with their own password, they're unexpectedly
  granted access to privileged operations that should require administrator credentials.

  The issue is that the PolicyKit policy configuration allows standard users to
  authenticate using only their own credentials (self-authentication) instead of
  requiring administrator-level authentication for all authorization modes (active,
  inactive, and any session types).

  The expected behavior is that privileged operations in zuluPolkit should require
  administrator authentication (i.e., user must be in the admin/sudo group and provide
  admin credentials). Standard users should not be able to access these privileged
  operations by simply entering their own password.

  The problem appears to be in the build configuration that generates the PolicyKit
  policy file. The policy settings need to enforce administrator authentication across
  all authorization modes.
