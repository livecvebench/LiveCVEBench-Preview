# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Zoraxy is a general-purpose HTTP reverse proxy and forwarding tool that includes a Web SSH terminal for authenticated users to connect to SSH servers from the browser.
  
  I configured the Web SSH terminal and attempted to create SSH sessions through the web interface as an authenticated user.
  
  I observed that providing a crafted username when creating a session results in arbitrary commands being executed on the host as root, not just establishing the SSH connection.
  
  Please fix the Web SSH session creation so that creating a session cannot be used to execute commands on the host.
