# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  OpenCanary is a multi-protocol network honeypot for detecting and logging suspicious activity across common services.
  
  I deployed it with the daemon running as root and its configuration stored in an unprivileged user's directory.
  
  I found that commands included in the config are executed by the daemon, allowing the unprivileged user to edit the config and have those commands run with root privileges when the daemon starts.
  
  Please fix this issue so unprivileged users cannot trigger command execution via configuration changes or gain elevated privileges when the daemon runs.
