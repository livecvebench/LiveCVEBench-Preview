# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Kyverno is a Kubernetes policy engine used to enforce platform rules and verify artifact signatures.
  
  I configured keyless signature verification policies that specify subjectRegExp and issuerRegExp to restrict which certificates are allowed.
  
  In testing, artifacts signed with unexpected certificates still pass verification in keyless mode, allowing deployment of resources that should be blocked and risking cluster compromise.
  
  Please fix this so Kyverno enforces subjectRegExp and issuerRegExp during keyless verification to prevent unauthorized resource deployments.
