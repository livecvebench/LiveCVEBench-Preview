instruction: |-
  This application is a web server protected by ModSecurity Web Application Firewall.
  ModSecurity is configured with rules that sanitize sensitive parameters (like passwords)
  from audit logs to prevent credential exposure.

  Users report that the server becomes extremely slow or unresponsive when processing
  login forms with normal data. System monitoring shows Apache processes consuming
  excessive amounts of memory (hundreds of MB to gigabytes) when handling simple POST
  requests to login endpoints. After several such requests, the server crashes with
  out-of-memory errors and must be restarted.

  The issue appears to be related to how the sanitization feature processes form
  parameters. When a POST request contains multiple form fields (which is normal for
  login forms that may include hidden fields, CSRF tokens, etc.), memory usage spikes
  dramatically and response times increase from milliseconds to tens of seconds.

  We expect the server to handle POST requests with any reasonable number of form
  parameters efficiently, without excessive memory consumption or performance degradation.
  The sanitization feature should work correctly while maintaining stable resource usage.
