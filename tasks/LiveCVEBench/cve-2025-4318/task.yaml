  This is the AWS Amplify UI code generator (@aws-amplify/codegen-ui-react), which
  converts component schemas into React code.

  When processing component JSON files, I noticed that whatever text I put in the
  `bindingProperties.property` field of a component schema ends up directly in
  the generated code without any checks. For example, if I set the property to
  something like "require('child_process')" or "eval('...')", those exact strings
  appear in the generated React component code.

  This seems problematic - if component schemas are coming from user input or an
  external source, someone could potentially inject arbitrary JavaScript code
  into the generated output. The code generator should probably be checking
  and sanitizing these property values before using them in the generated code.

  Steps to reproduce:
  1. Create a component JSON with a bindingProperties.property containing JavaScript code
  2. Run the code generator (AmplifyRenderer.renderComponent())
  3. Observe that the code appears verbatim in the output

  Expected: Property values should be validated to only allow safe identifier names.
  Actual: Any string passes through unchanged to the generated code.
