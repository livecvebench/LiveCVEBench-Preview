instruction: |-
  This is a pet management module for a charitable institution web application
  (WeGIA). The pet profile page allows viewing and managing pet information.

  The pet profile page at `/html/pet/profile_pet.php` accepts an `id_pet`
  parameter to identify which pet's profile to display. However, there is no
  proper input validation for this parameter.

  When users provide malformed or invalid values for `id_pet` (such as
  non-numeric strings, negative numbers, or special characters), the page
  either returns unexpected errors or behaves unpredictably. The application
  should validate that `id_pet` is a valid positive integer and return a
  proper error response (HTTP 400) with an appropriate error message when
  invalid input is provided.

  For example, requests with `id_pet=abc`, `id_pet=-1`, or `id_pet=0` should
  be rejected with a clear error message, not processed as if they were
  legitimate pet IDs.
