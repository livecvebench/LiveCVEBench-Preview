  This is YesWiki, a PHP-based wiki system that provides content management
  features including page editing and site backup capabilities through a
  REST API.

  When accessing the backup/archive API endpoints, I noticed they respond
  to requests without requiring any authentication. For example:

  - `GET /?api/archives` returns a list of backup files (or empty array)
  - `POST /?api/archives` triggers backup creation
  - `GET /?api/archives/{filename}` downloads backup files

  The API documentation at `/?api` clearly marks these as "ONLY_FOR_ADMINS",
  but the endpoints work without logging in.

  Expected behavior:
  - Archive API endpoints should require administrator authentication
  - Non-authenticated users should receive 401/403 errors
  - Only logged-in administrators should access backup operations
