  This WordPress site uses a URL shortening plugin that provides administrators with an
  interface to create and manage short links.

  When editing a link through the admin interface, the page renders incorrectly if the
  "id" parameter in the URL contains unexpected characters. Instead of validating that
  the link ID is a valid numeric database identifier, the application accepts and
  processes arbitrary string values.

  For example, when the id parameter contains non-numeric content (e.g., special
  characters, quotes, or spaces), the page still attempts to render but produces
  malformed HTML output. The id parameter value ends up being embedded directly into
  HTML attributes without proper encoding.

  The expected behavior is that the application should only accept valid positive
  integer IDs for the link editing functionality. If a non-numeric or malformed ID
  is provided, it should be treated as invalid (equivalent to no ID or ID of 0) and
  the page should gracefully handle this case rather than rendering with the raw
  input value embedded in the HTML.

  Please fix this input validation issue so that the id parameter is properly
  sanitized before use.
