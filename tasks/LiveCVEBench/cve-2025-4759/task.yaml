  This application is a lockfile linting library that validates npm/yarn lockfiles
  to ensure package integrity and trust. The ValidatePackageNames validator checks
  that packages in lockfiles point to their correct corresponding URLs on the registry.

  Users are reporting that the package name validation can be bypassed in certain scenarios.
  When a lockfile entry declares a package (e.g., "commander") but the resolved URL points
  to a different package with a similar name (e.g., "commander2" or "commanderx"), the
  validation incorrectly passes when it should fail.

  For example, a lockfile entry like this should trigger a validation error but doesn't:

    "commander@4.1.1": {
      "version": "4.1.1",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/commander2/-/commander-4.1.1.tgz"
    }

  The expected behavior is that the validator should detect when the resolved URL points
  to a package with a different name than what was declared, and report an error.

  The issue appears to be in the package name matching logic in the ValidatePackageNames
  validator (src/validators/ValidatePackageNames.js).
