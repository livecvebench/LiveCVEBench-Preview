# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Argo CD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
  
  I configured an AppProject with approved git/Helm/OCI sources and RBAC so some users have application create privileges but not override/local sync, then tested creating a new application.
  
  I found those users can still sync local manifests during app creation, bypassing the approved source requirement, while other AppProject restrictions remain enforced.
  
  Please fix this so local manifests cannot be synced on app creation unless the user has override privileges, and the approved source requirement is always enforced.
