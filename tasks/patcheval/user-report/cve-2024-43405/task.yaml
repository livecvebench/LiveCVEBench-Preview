# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Nuclei is a vulnerability scanner powered by YAML-based templates.
  
  I executed custom code templates from third-party sources in the CLI and enabled user templates in my SDK integration.
  
  I found that templates with valid signatures can still carry extra code that runs, allowing unverified templates to bypass the signature check.
  
  Please fix the template signature verification so custom templates cannot bypass checks and only fully verified content is executed.
