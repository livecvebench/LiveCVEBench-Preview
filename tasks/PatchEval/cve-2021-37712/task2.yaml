  When extracting tar archives, the path reservation system does not account for Unicode normalization or short path equivalence on Windows. Directory paths with different Unicode representations that normalize to the same path, or short path (8.3) equivalents, can bypass the symlink protection and allow files to be written to unintended locations. The path comparison should normalize paths before checking.
