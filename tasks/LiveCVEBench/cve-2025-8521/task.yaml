  This application is Vvveb CMS, a PHP-based content management system with a visual
  page builder and admin panel.

  Users have reported that when custom content types are created through the admin
  panel (at /vadmin123/index.php?module=settings/post-types), certain special
  characters in the content type name cause the admin interface to behave
  unexpectedly.

  When a content type name contains characters like quotes, angle brackets, or other
  HTML special characters (e.g., a type named `test">example` or similar), these
  characters appear to be rendered as raw HTML in the admin sidebar menu. This causes
  the menu layout to break and, in some cases, embedded content is executed by the
  browser instead of being displayed as plain text.

  We expect the admin menu to safely display any content type name as plain text,
  regardless of what characters it contains. Special characters should be rendered
  literally without affecting the page structure or causing browser-side code
  execution.

  The issue appears to be in the template file that renders the admin sidebar menu,
  where user-provided values are output without proper encoding.
