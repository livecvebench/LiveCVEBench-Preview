  The static file server allows reading files outside the designated public directory when path traversal sequences are included in the request URL. For example, requesting "/../../../etc/file.txt" returns files from outside the intended serving directory. The path handling should validate and normalize request paths to ensure files can only be served from within the configured root directory.
