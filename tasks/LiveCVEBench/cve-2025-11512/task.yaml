instruction: |-
  This is a PHP-based voting system that allows administrators to manage voters and
  candidates for elections. The admin panel provides functionality to add, edit,
  and delete voters and candidates.

  Users have reported a display rendering issue: when voter or candidate records
  contain special characters (such as angle brackets < >, quotes " ', or ampersands &),
  the data is displayed incorrectly. In some cases, the browser interprets parts of the
  stored data as HTML elements instead of displaying them as plain text.

  For example, if an administrator adds a voter with a name like "O'Brien & Sons" or
  a test record containing "<test>", the display page shows unexpected behavior -
  parts of the text may disappear, page formatting may break, or in some cases
  JavaScript code embedded in the data field executes in the browser.

  We expect the application to display user-provided data exactly as entered, treating
  all stored text as plain content rather than HTML markup. Names and other text fields
  should be rendered safely regardless of what characters they contain.

  - Voters management: adding and listing voters
  - Candidates management: adding and listing candidates
