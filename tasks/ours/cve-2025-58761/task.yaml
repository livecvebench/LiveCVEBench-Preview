# CVE-2025-58761
instruction: |-
  A path traversal vulnerability exists in Tautulli versions prior to 2.16.0. The `real_pms_image_proxy` endpoint contains an unauthenticated path traversal vulnerability where attackers can bypass validation by prepending a valid prefix followed by traversal characters (e.g., 'dir/../../filename') to read arbitrary files on the server. This includes sensitive files such as the SQLite database containing JWT tokens and the configuration file containing credentials and secrets. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to access sensitive information without authentication. The issue is fixed in version 2.16.0.
