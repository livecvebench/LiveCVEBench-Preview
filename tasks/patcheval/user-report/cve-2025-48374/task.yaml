# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  zot is a container image and artifact registry that implements the OCI Distribution Specification.
  
  I deployed zot with Keycloak as the OIDC provider and supplied a client secret, then started the container.
  
  I saw the OIDC client secret printed in the container's stdout logs during startup.
  
  Please ensure secrets are not logged and fix the startup logs so the client secret is never exposed.
