  This is a PHP-based tracking system that allows administrators to log in and
  manage data. The application uses a MySQL database for storing user information.

  When testing the admin login functionality with certain unusual username inputs
  (e.g., usernames containing special characters like single quotes or SQL keywords),
  the application behaves unexpectedly:

  1. Submitting a username like "admin'--" with any password results in a successful
     login as the admin user, even though the password is incorrect.

  2. Submitting a username containing SQL timing functions (e.g., with "SLEEP(5)")
     causes the login request to take significantly longer than normal (several
     seconds), suggesting that user input is being processed in unexpected ways.

  3. When login fails, the error response includes a "last_qry" field that exposes
     the raw database query being executed, which is concerning from a security
     perspective.

  We expect the login form to properly validate credentials without these
  anomalous behaviors. Valid credentials (username: "admin", password: "admin123")
  should work, invalid credentials should be rejected quickly, and internal query
  details should not be exposed in responses.
