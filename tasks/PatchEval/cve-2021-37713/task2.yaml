instruction: |-
  When extracting tar archives on Windows systems, paths with different drive letters are not properly sanitized. A path like "C:some\path" is resolved against the current working directory on that drive rather than the extraction target. The path sanitization should properly handle Windows drive letters and path traversal patterns.
