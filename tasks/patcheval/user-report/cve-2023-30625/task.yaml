# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  rudder-server is part of RudderStack and powers our open-source Customer Data Platform by collecting and routing customer event data.
  
  I deployed rudder-server backed by PostgreSQL and set up ingestion endpoints to accept user event payloads from web and mobile.
  
  During testing, I observed that crafted request payloads can trigger SQL statements to be executed, and in some cases this led to remote code execution on the server.
  
  Please fix this issue so user input cannot lead to SQL injection or any form of code execution, and provide an update we can apply.
