  This is a WordPress plugin called "Find Me On" that allows users to display social
  network profile icons in a sidebar widget. The plugin stores social network links
  in the database and provides an admin interface for managing them.

  When authenticated users (including those with Subscriber role) send delete requests
  through the AJAX endpoint, the application experiences unexpected behavior. Sending
  specially crafted values in the linkId parameter causes the application to behave
  inconsistently - sometimes database operations take unexpectedly long, and in some
  cases, error messages reveal internal database query details.

  For example, if a user sends a linkId value like "1 AND 1=1" instead of a simple
  numeric ID, the database query executes without proper validation, potentially
  allowing unintended data access or manipulation.

  The expected behavior is that the linkId parameter should only accept valid positive
  integers. Any non-numeric or malformed input should be rejected gracefully before
  reaching the database layer.

  Review the wp_ajax_find_me_on_delete_network() function in find-me-on.php and
  implement proper input validation to ensure only valid integer IDs are processed.
