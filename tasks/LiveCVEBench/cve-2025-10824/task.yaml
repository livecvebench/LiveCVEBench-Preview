  fio is a popular I/O benchmarking tool for testing storage devices and filesystems.

  When parsing job configuration files that contain an `include` statement without
  a filename argument, the application crashes unexpectedly. I accidentally left an
  incomplete include directive in my job file and fio just crashes instead of
  telling me what's wrong.

  For example, a job file like:
  ```
  [global]
  runtime=300

  [job1]
  rw=read
  include
  ```

  When processed with `./fio --parse-only jobfile`, causes the program to crash
  instead of reporting an appropriate error message about the malformed include
  directive.

  The expected behavior is that fio should gracefully handle malformed job files
  and report a meaningful error message rather than crashing.
