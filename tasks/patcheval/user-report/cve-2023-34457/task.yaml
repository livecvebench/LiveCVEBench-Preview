# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  MechanicalSoup is a Python library for automating interaction with websites and submitting HTML forms.
  
  I used it to submit forms to a web server, relying on the library’s default handling of form fields and not manually resetting their values.
  
  I found that when the server includes an input type="file" field, my client uploads local files I did not intend, allowing the server to read arbitrary files from my machine.
  
  Please prevent this behavior so form submissions cannot expose local files through file inputs, even under default settings.
