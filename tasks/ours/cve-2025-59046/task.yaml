  This application is an interactive CLI tool for git branch switching. It provides
  the `igc` command that prompts users for a branch name and performs git checkout.

  We've received reports that when users enter branch names containing certain special
  characters (like semicolons, pipes, or backticks), the application exhibits unexpected
  behavior. Instead of simply failing to find the branch, the input appears to be
  interpreted in unintended ways by the underlying shell.

  For example, when a user mistakenly enters a branch name like "feature;test" (perhaps
  trying to separate multiple branch attempts), or when pasting text that contains
  shell metacharacters, the application may execute unintended operations.

  The issue appears to be in how the application constructs and executes git commands.
  The affected files are in the `src/` directory where child process execution occurs:
  - `src/checkout.js` - handles checking out to existing branches
  - `src/checkoutToNew.js` - handles creating and checking out to new branches
  - `src/getBranches.js` - lists available branches

  We expect the application to treat branch names as literal strings, regardless of
  what special characters they may contain. Branch names with special characters
  should either be handled literally or rejected gracefully, but should never cause
  shell interpretation of embedded characters.
