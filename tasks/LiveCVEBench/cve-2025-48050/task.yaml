  This is a minimal static file server built with Node.js that serves files from
  its working directory over HTTP. It's designed for local development and testing
  purposes.

  Users have reported a security issue: when certain URL patterns containing path
  traversal sequences are used in HTTP requests, the server may serve files from
  locations outside its intended working directory. For example, requests with
  patterns like "/../../somefile" can potentially access files that should not be
  exposed.

  The expected behavior is that the server should only serve files from within its
  working directory. Any attempts to access files outside this directory should be
  rejected with an appropriate error response.
