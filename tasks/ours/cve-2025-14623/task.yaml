  This application is a Student File Management System (SFMS) that allows administrators
  to manage student records, including adding, updating, and deleting student information.

  When updating a student's information through the admin panel (/admin/update_student.php),
  the application exhibits unexpected behavior with certain input values. If the student ID
  field contains special characters like single quotes, the database query may produce
  unintended results - including modifying wrong records or causing significant delays
  in response time.

  For example, when attempting to update a student record, if the input contains certain
  character sequences, the server response becomes significantly slower than normal
  (taking several seconds instead of responding immediately).

  We expect the application to treat all user input as literal data values, regardless of
  what special characters they contain. The update operation should either succeed with the
  provided ID (if it exists as a valid numeric ID) or fail gracefully without executing
  unintended database commands.
