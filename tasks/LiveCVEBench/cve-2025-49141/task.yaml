  This application is a headless CMS (Content Management System) that allows users
  to create and manage websites. It includes a Git integration feature for importing
  sites from remote repositories.

  When using the Git import functionality via the API endpoint, special characters
  in the repository URL are not being properly escaped before being passed to shell
  commands. This means that if a user provides a URL containing shell metacharacters
  (such as semicolons, pipes, or dollar signs), those characters may be interpreted
  by the shell rather than treated as literal parts of the URL.

  For example, when importing from a URL like:
    http://example.com/repo.git;echo test

  The part after the semicolon could be executed as a separate command instead of
  being treated as part of the URL string.

  We expect all URL parameters to be properly escaped before being used in shell
  commands to prevent unintended command execution.

  The relevant code is in the Git wrapper library that handles remote repository
  operations.
