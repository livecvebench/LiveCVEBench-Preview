  This is the Open Asset Import Library (assimp), a library to load various 3D 
  model formats (OBJ, FBX, LWS, etc.) into a unified in-memory format.

  When I try to process certain LightWave Scene (.lws) files, the application 
  crashes with a segmentation fault. For example, when running:assimp info malformed.lws
    
  The application crashes instead of returning an error message. The crash 
  appears to occur during scene node tree traversal, with a stack trace like:
  SEGV on unknown address 0x000000000000#0 in Assimp::SceneCombiner::AddNodeHashes(...)
    
  Expected behavior:
  - The application should handle malformed input files gracefully
  - Invalid LWS files should return an error message, not crash
  - The parser should validate node references before dereferencing
