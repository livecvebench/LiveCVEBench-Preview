# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. The Grafana Labs CSV datasource plugin lets administrators retrieve and process CSV data from a configured remote endpoint.
  
  I deployed the CSV datasource plugin and configured it to send requests to a bare host with no path (e.g., https://www.example.com/).
  
  With this setup, any user can craft a request that makes Grafana contact an endpoint other than the one I configured, exposing an SSRF vector.
  
  Please fix the CSV datasource so requests are strictly limited to the configured endpoint when a bare host is used and cannot be altered by user input.
