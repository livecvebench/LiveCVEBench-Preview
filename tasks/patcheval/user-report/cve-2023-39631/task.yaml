# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  LangChain is a framework for building applications that connect large language models to tools, chains, and APIs.
  
  I built an endpoint that evaluates user-provided expressions through LangChain using numexpr.evaluate.
  
  I found that remote requests can trigger arbitrary code execution on the server via this evaluate path.
  
  Please fix this so expression evaluation through LangChain is safe for untrusted input and cannot execute code.
