instruction: |-
  The HTTP request parser is incorrectly handling Transfer-Encoding headers that contain special whitespace characters. When a request has unusual whitespace in the Transfer-Encoding header, the parser interprets it as chunked encoding, but some proxy servers might fall back to Content-Length. This inconsistency can cause requests to be parsed differently by different servers in the chain.
