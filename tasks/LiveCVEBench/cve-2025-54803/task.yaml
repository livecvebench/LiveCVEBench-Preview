  This application uses js-toml, a TOML parser library, to load and process
  configuration files.

  We've discovered a severe bug where parsing certain TOML files causes unexpected
  side effects on unrelated objects throughout the application. For example, after
  parsing a TOML configuration, objects that were created before the parsing
  suddenly have new properties that were never assigned to them.

  Steps to reproduce:
  1. Create a JavaScript object (e.g., `const user = { username: "test" }`)
  2. Parse a TOML file that contains table headers with certain key names
  3. Access properties on the original object that were never set
  4. The object mysteriously has values it shouldn't have

  For instance, after parsing TOML with a `[__proto__]` table header, all objects
  in the application inherit the properties defined in that section. This means
  `user.isAdmin` might return `true` even though it was never set on the user
  object.

  Expected behavior: Parsed TOML data should remain isolated and should not affect
  any objects outside of the returned parsed result. The parser should create
  objects in a way that prevents this cross-contamination issue.

  The bug appears to be in how the TOML interpreter creates internal objects
  during the parsing process. Please investigate and fix the object creation
  pattern used in the parser.
