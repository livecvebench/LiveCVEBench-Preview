  AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) is a file integrity monitoring tool
  that detects unauthorized changes to files by comparing current file states against
  a known database.

  When files or directories contain special control characters (such as escape sequences
  like those starting with 0x1b) in their names, AIDE outputs these characters directly
  to reports and logs without sanitization. This causes display issues when reports
  are viewed in terminals - escape sequences are interpreted by the terminal emulator
  rather than displayed literally.

  For example, a filename containing "\033[1A" (ANSI cursor-up sequence) causes the
  terminal cursor to move up when the report is displayed. This can result in report
  entries being overwritten or hidden, making it difficult to accurately review file
  integrity check results.

  Similar issues occur with:
  - Symlink targets containing control characters
  - Extended attribute key names with control characters
  - Configuration values containing control characters

  The expected behavior is that all control characters (ASCII 0x00-0x1F and 0x7F)
  should be properly escaped in output, appearing as their octal representation
  (e.g., "\033" for escape) rather than being interpreted by the terminal.

  This affects multiple output locations in the codebase including plain text reports,
  JSON reports, log messages, and progress status displays.
