  This is a PHP web application for managing a product catalog. It allows administrators
  to add, update, and delete products with associated pricing and availability information.

  When users attempt to update a product through the update form and submit unusual
  characters in form fields (particularly the product ID field, which is typically
  hidden), the application exhibits strange behavior:

  1. Submitting form data with special characters like single quotes in hidden fields
     causes database errors or unexpected application behavior
  2. In some cases, the application hangs for several seconds before responding
  3. Database integrity appears to be affected - products may be incorrectly modified
     or the application may expose database error messages

  We expect the product update functionality to properly handle all input and securely
  interact with the database without these issues. The update feature should work
  correctly for valid product data while safely rejecting malformed input.

  The main functionality is in the product update page (`/pet1/update_cnp.php`), which
  handles both displaying the product list and processing update requests via POST.
