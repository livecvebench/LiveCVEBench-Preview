# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  go-zero is a web and RPC framework for building services and APIs.
  
  I configured the CORS filter in my go-zero service with an allowlist of trusted domains.
  
  Requests from lookalike or malicious domains are passing the CORS check, allowing pages that shouldn’t be trusted to make requests and read data on behalf of users.
  
  Please fix this so the CORS allowlist is enforced correctly and untrusted origins are rejected.
