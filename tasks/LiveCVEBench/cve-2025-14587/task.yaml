  This is an Online Pet Shop Management System built with PHP and MySQL. It allows
  customers to browse available pets and place orders through a web interface.

  Users have reported that the order submission functionality at /pet1/availableframe.php
  is behaving unexpectedly. When certain special characters are entered in the customer
  name field (such as single quotes or dashes), the application either:

  1. Takes an unusually long time to respond (sometimes 5+ seconds for simple requests)
  2. Shows database error messages in the response
  3. Exhibits inconsistent behavior where orders are processed differently based on
     the exact characters used in the name field

  The expected behavior is that the order form should accept any valid customer name
  and process orders consistently, without exposing internal error messages or causing
  performance degradation.

  The order form accepts the following fields: name, address, contact number, quantity,
  order type (Deliver/Pick-up), and pickup date. The vulnerability appears to be related
  to how the name field is processed before database operations.
