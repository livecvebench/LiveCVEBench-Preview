  The redirect URL validation in the OAuth2 flow can be bypassed by including HTML-encoded whitespace characters in the URL. When a redirect URL contains encoded whitespace, the validation passes but the URL is interpreted differently by the browser, potentially allowing redirects to unintended destinations. The validation should decode and properly check URLs before allowing them.
