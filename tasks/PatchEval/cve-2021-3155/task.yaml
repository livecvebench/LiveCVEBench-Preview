instruction: |-
  snapd 2.54.2 and earlier created ~/snap directories in user home directories without specifying owner-only permissions. This could allow a local attacker to read information that should have been private. Fixed in snapd versions 2.54.3+18.04, 2.54.3+20.04 and 2.54.3+21.10.1
  Vulnerability Location:
    File path:cmd/snap/cmd_run.go, start line:376, end line:414
