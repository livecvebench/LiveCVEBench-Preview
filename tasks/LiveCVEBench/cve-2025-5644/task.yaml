  This project is radare2, a reverse engineering framework that includes the radiff2 tool
  for binary diffing.

  The radiff2 tool has an experimental threading feature enabled by the -T flag for parallel
  file loading. However, when users invoke this flag, they receive no indication that the
  feature is experimental and may cause instability.

  For example, running:
    radiff2 -T file1 file2

  Users expect either a working feature or a clear warning. Currently, the tool silently
  enables threading mode without informing users of the potential stability issues.

  The application should warn users when they enable experimental features so they can
  make informed decisions about using potentially unstable functionality.
