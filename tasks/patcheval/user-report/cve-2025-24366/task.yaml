# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  SFTPGo is an open-source, event-driven file transfer server that lets users transfer files and execute a defined set of commands via SSH, including an optional rsync command limited to the local filesystem.
  
  I enabled the optional rsync command for SSH in my SFTPGo instance to support local filesystem transfers.
  
  I found that an authenticated user can use certain rsync options to read or write files with the SFTPGo server’s permissions, accessing data beyond what is allowed.
  
  Please fix this so rsync cannot be used to read or modify files outside permitted directories and so client-provided options are properly constrained.
