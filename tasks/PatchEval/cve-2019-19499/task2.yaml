instruction: |-
  When configuring a MySQL data source with a custom configuration file path, the application reads files from locations it shouldn't access. If a user with data source configuration privileges specifies a path outside the intended directory, the application will read that file's contents. The file path validation should restrict access to only allowed directories.
