instruction: |-
  The is_safe_url() function incorrectly considers some numeric URLs as safe when they should not be. When validating redirect URLs, certain URL formats that start with numbers or use unusual numeric patterns are being accepted as safe even though they point to external domains. The URL validation should properly handle all numeric URL formats and correctly identify them as external redirects.
