  Feng Office is a web-based collaboration and project management application that
  allows users to upload and manage documents. The application extracts text content
  from DOCX and ODT files for search indexing purposes.

  Users have reported that when processing certain DOCX or ODT files, the application
  makes unexpected outbound HTTP requests to external URLs. This behavior was observed
  in server access logs showing requests to URLs that were embedded within uploaded
  documents.

  Additionally, the document processing system appears to be reading internal server
  files when processing specific document structures. System administrators noticed
  that some uploaded documents caused the application to access files like
  /etc/passwd and configuration files, which should not be accessible during
  normal document text extraction.

  The expected behavior is that document text extraction should only parse the
  document content itself without making any external network requests or accessing
  local server files. The text extraction functionality should work normally for
  legitimate documents while preventing access to external resources and local
  file system content.

  The issue appears to be related to how XML content within the document archives
  is being parsed. Please investigate and fix the document processing functionality
  to prevent unauthorized external requests and local file access while maintaining
  normal text extraction capabilities.
