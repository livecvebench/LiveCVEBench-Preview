  This is a Volto application, a React-based frontend for a content management system
  that runs as a Node.js server with Express middleware.

  Users have reported that the application crashes with a TypeError when they attempt
  to access certain URLs. The crash occurs when visiting URLs that contain unusual
  patterns like double slashes at the beginning of the path (e.g., "//:something@host").
  The error message observed in the logs is:

      TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'startsWith')

  This happens in the development proxy middleware that handles API routing. The server
  terminates entirely when this error occurs, requiring a manual restart.

  We expect the application to handle these malformed URLs gracefully without crashing.
  Even if the URL is invalid, the server should remain stable and continue serving
  other requests.
