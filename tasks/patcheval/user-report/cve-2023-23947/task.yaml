# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Argo CD is a declarative GitOps tool for Kubernetes that manages application deployments and cluster connections.
  
  I set up Argo CD with multiple clusters and configured RBAC so a user could update one specific cluster secret.
  
  That user is able to update any cluster secret, not just the one intended, which lets them escalate privileges or break connections to external clusters.
  
  Please fix the authorization for cluster secret updates so access is limited to the specific secret granted and cannot be used to update others.
