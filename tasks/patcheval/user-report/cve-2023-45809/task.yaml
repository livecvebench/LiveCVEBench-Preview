# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Wagtail is an open-source content management system built on Django for managing site content through an admin interface.
  
  Using a limited-permission editor account, I made a direct URL request to the admin view that handles bulk actions on user accounts.
  
  I can't make any changes, but the response error reveals user display names, and by adjusting URL parameters I can retrieve the display name for any user. Ordinary site visitors without admin access cannot reach this view.
  
  Please fix the admin bulk user actions view so it does not disclose user display names or any user data to accounts without appropriate permissions.
