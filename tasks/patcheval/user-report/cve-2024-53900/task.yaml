# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Mongoose is a Node.js ODM for MongoDB that lets developers define schemas and work with data through models, queries, and aggregations.
  
  I built search endpoints that assemble match filters from request parameters using Mongoose queries and aggregation pipelines.
  
  I found that certain crafted inputs cause the query to evaluate a $where expression, altering the search and returning records outside the intended filter (search injection).
  
  Please fix this so match-based queries do not evaluate $where from user input and are protected against search injection.
