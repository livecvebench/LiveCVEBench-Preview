  This is a WordPress site with an SEO plugin called "Simple SEO" that allows
  users to customize SEO metadata for posts (title, description, keywords, etc.).

  When a user with Contributor role creates or edits a post and enters special
  characters in the SEO fields (such as the "Title" field in the SEO meta box),
  these characters are not being displayed correctly when an administrator or
  other user views the post in the WordPress admin editor.

  Specifically, when someone enters text containing HTML-like characters such as
  angle brackets (<, >), quotes (", '), or other special characters in the SEO
  Title field, these characters appear to be rendered as actual HTML markup
  instead of being displayed as plain text. This causes the admin interface to
  behave unexpectedly and could allow malicious content to be executed in the
  browser.

  The plugin should properly sanitize all user-provided SEO field values before
  displaying them in the admin interface to ensure that special characters are
  shown as literal text rather than being interpreted as HTML or JavaScript code.

  The vulnerable code is in the plugin's meta box rendering functionality where
  post metadata is retrieved and output to the page.
