  In the federated learning framework, the sync_tree function in the hetero decision tree module is sharing more information than necessary during the training process. When performing collaborative machine learning between parties, some data that should remain private is being transmitted during tree synchronization. The information sharing should be minimized to only what's required for the training process.
