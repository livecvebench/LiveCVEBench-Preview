# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Apache Airflow is a platform for authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows (DAGs).
  
  I enabled DAG authors to use the doc_md field to document their DAGs.
  
  I found that an authenticated DAG author can craft doc_md in a way that triggers code execution in the scheduler context, which is supposed to be forbidden.
  
  Please fix this so doc_md cannot execute code and the scheduler remains protected according to the security model.
