  This is a WordPress plugin called "Custom Admin Menu" that allows administrators to
  customize the WordPress dashboard menu. The plugin is installed at:
  /var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/custom-admin-menu/

  The plugin displays status messages on its settings page after performing actions
  (like saving settings or resetting configuration). These messages are passed via
  URL parameters and displayed to the user.

  When a message contains special characters like angle brackets (< >) or quotes,
  these characters are rendered literally in the HTML output instead of being
  displayed as text. For example, a message containing "<test>" shows nothing
  visible on the page because the browser interprets it as an HTML tag.

  We expect all user-provided message content to be displayed as literal text,
  with special HTML characters properly escaped so they appear exactly as intended
  rather than being interpreted as HTML markup.
