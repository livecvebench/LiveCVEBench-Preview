# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  OpenFGA is a high-performance, flexible authorization and permission engine for developers, inspired by Google Zanzibar.
  
  I integrated OpenFGA into our service and rely on Check and ListObject calls to enforce access control.
  
  I found that authorization is bypassed in some cases: these calls sometimes allow access or list objects for principals who should be denied.
  
  Please fix this so Check and ListObject correctly enforce permissions and cannot be bypassed.
