  WeGIA is an open-source web management system for charitable institutions. The
  application includes an employee pre-registration form at
  /html/funcionario/pre_cadastro_funcionario.php.

  When displaying status messages via the `msg_e` (error) or `msg_c` (success) URL
  parameters, the application renders special characters incorrectly. For example,
  if a message contains HTML entities like `<`, `>`, or `"`, these characters are
  rendered literally instead of being displayed as text.

  This causes problems when:
  1. Error messages from form validation contain angle brackets (e.g., "Field <name>
     is required")
  2. Messages include user-generated content that may contain special characters
  3. The message text includes quotation marks or ampersands

  We expect the application to properly escape all special characters in message
  parameters so they display as visible text rather than being interpreted as HTML
  markup.
