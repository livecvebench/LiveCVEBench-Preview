# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  MLflow is an open-source platform for experiment tracking, model management, and artifact storage and retrieval.
  
  I run an MLflow tracking server and allow users to download artifacts via URLs.
  
  I found that certain crafted artifact URLs that include a '#' let users fetch files outside the artifact store, allowing reads of arbitrary local files such as SSH or cloud keys.
  
  Please fix the artifact URL handling so these requests cannot access files outside the intended artifact locations, even when a '#' is present in the URL.
