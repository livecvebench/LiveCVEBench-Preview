  The static file handler allows access to files outside the designated public directory when extra slashes are appended to the URL path. Requests with URLs like "//../../etc/file.txt" or "/path///../../file" return files from outside the configured static directory. The path handling should normalize URLs and prevent access to files outside the intended serving directory.
