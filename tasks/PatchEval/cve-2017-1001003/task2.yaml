  When creating objects in math.js, property names containing unicode characters are being processed incorrectly. If I use unicode characters that look similar to regular characters in property names, they can accidentally override built-in properties like "constructor". The library should normalize or validate property names to prevent unicode lookalike characters from affecting reserved properties.
