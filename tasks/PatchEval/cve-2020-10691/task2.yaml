instruction: |-
  When installing an Ansible Galaxy collection from a tar.gz file, the extraction process does not properly sanitize filenames. If the archive contains files with path traversal sequences like "../" in their names, the files get extracted outside the intended collection directory. The extraction should validate filenames to prevent writing files outside the target directory.
