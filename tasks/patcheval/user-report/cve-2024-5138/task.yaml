# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  This repository includes snapd and its snapctl tool, which lets confined snaps request privileged actions from the snapd daemon.
  
  I built a confined snap that invokes snapctl and tested various command-line calls from a standard (non-admin) user account.
  
  I observed that an unprivileged user can trigger an authorized action on behalf of the snap via snapctl, even though it should require administrator privileges, which can be used to cause a denial of service.
  
  Please fix this so snapctl only executes authorized actions when the caller has the required privileges, preventing unprivileged users from invoking them.
