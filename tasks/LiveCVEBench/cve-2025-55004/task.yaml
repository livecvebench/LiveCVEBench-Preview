  I'm using ImageMagick to process image files on our web application, and we're
  encountering a crash when processing certain MNG (Multiple-image Network Graphics)
  files that users upload.

  The issue seems to happen specifically when resizing or magnifying certain MNG
  images. When I run a command like:

    magick input.mng -resize 200x200 output.png

  The program sometimes crashes with a memory error. Not all MNG files cause
  this - it appears to be related to images that have transparency or alpha
  channels configured in a specific way.

  We're using ImageMagick version 7.1.2-0. The crash happens intermittently
  and the error message suggests some kind of buffer issue during image
  processing.

  Could you investigate and fix the issue so that MNG files with alpha
  channels can be processed safely?
