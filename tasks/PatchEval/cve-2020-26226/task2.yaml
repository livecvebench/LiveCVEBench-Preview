instruction: |-
  When masking sensitive values in log output, the masking logic does not handle URL-encoded versions of the secrets. If a secret contains special characters like @, #, or %, the URL-encoded form (e.g., %40, %23, %25) appears in plain text in the logs while only the original form is masked. The masking should also hide URL-encoded versions of sensitive values.
