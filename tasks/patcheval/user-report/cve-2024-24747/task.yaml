# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  MinIO is high-performance object storage.
  
  I created access keys under a parent key to restrict s3 access for specific workloads.
  
  These child keys inherit admin permissions from the parent and can change their own s3 permissions to be more permissive, effectively bypassing the intended restrictions.
  
  Please fix this so access keys only get the intended permissions and cannot escalate or modify their own permissions.
