# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  ffcss is a CLI tool to apply and configure Firefox CSS themes.
  
  I use the theme lookup that searches names case-insensitively while ignoring dashes, underscores, and dots.
  
  I noticed users can bypass that behavior by entering Unicode lookalike characters (e.g., U+FE4D), which end up reintroducing an underscore or similar blocked characters in the search.
  
  Please fix the input handling so theme lookup consistently ignores - _ . and cannot be bypassed with Unicode equivalents.
