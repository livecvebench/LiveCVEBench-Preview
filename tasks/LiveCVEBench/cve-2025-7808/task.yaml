  I'm using the WP Shopify plugin to display Shopify products on my WordPress site 
  using the [wp-shopify-continue-shopping] shortcode.
  
  I noticed something strange when customers share product links. If a product URL 
  contains unusual characters like quotes ("), the page doesn't display correctly - 
  parts of the layout break or content disappears.
  
  For example, when I visit:
    /shopify-test/?product=test"something
  
  The page structure looks broken compared to normal product names like:
    /shopify-test/?product=normal-product
  
  Can you investigate why special characters in the URL are causing display issues? 
  I want to make sure the site works reliably regardless of what's in the URL.
