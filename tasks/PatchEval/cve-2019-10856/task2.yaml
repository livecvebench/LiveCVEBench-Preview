  The login redirect URL validation has an issue where URLs with an empty network location component are not being properly rejected. When a URL like "///evil.com" is provided as the redirect target, the validation passes but the browser interprets it differently, potentially redirecting users to external sites. The URL validation should properly handle URLs with empty netloc values.
