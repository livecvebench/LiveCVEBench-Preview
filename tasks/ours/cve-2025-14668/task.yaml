  This is an Online Examination System that allows students (examinees) to log in
  and take exams. The application uses PHP with a MySQL database backend.

  Users have reported that the login endpoint at /query/loginExe.php behaves
  unexpectedly when certain special characters are entered in the username field.
  Specifically:

  1. When a username containing a single quote followed by "OR '1'='1" is submitted
     (e.g., "' OR '1'='1' --"), the system incorrectly returns a "success" response
     even though no matching user exists. This allows anyone to bypass authentication.

  2. When usernames containing SQL timing functions are submitted (e.g., containing
     "SLEEP(3)"), the server response is significantly delayed, suggesting that
     these functions are being executed by the database.

  The expected behavior is:
  - Login should only succeed with valid credentials that match a real user
  - Special characters in input should be treated as literal text, not as code
  - All login attempts with invalid credentials should consistently return "invalid"

  The login functionality must continue to work correctly for legitimate users
  after the fix is applied.
