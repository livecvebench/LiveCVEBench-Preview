  This is a School Management System built with PHP and MySQL that allows
  administrators to manage students, teachers, subjects, and notices.

  We've discovered that some API endpoints in the /assets/ directory (such as
  editSubject.php and addSubject.php) can be accessed directly without any user
  authentication. When sending HTTP POST requests directly to these endpoints
  (bypassing the admin panel), the operations are processed successfully even
  though no session or login is present.

  For example, a direct POST request to /assets/editSubject.php with subject
  name and subject_id parameters modifies the database, returning "success"
  without any authentication check. The same issue affects multiple endpoints
  that handle data modifications.

  The system has proper authentication infrastructure in place - there's a
  login-backend.php that sets session variables, and a noSessionRedirect.php
  file that checks for authenticated sessions. However, the data modification
  endpoints in /assets/ don't include these checks.

  We expect all data-modifying endpoints to verify that the user is properly
  authenticated before processing any requests, returning an appropriate error
  response (like HTTP 401) for unauthenticated access.
