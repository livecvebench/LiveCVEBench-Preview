# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  FlyteAdmin is the control plane for Flyte that manages entities and administers workflow executions.
  
  I deployed FlyteAdmin behind our VPN with authentication and used the list endpoints with REST filter parameters.
  
  I found that users can send filters containing custom SQL, and the list endpoints accept them, allowing data access or manipulation beyond expected permissions.
  
  Please fix the list endpoints so filter parameters are handled safely and cannot include or run arbitrary SQL.
