# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  containerd is an open-source container runtime that runs and manages containers, and it also provides a client library used by downstream applications.
  
  I deployed containers that rely on supplementary group membership for access control and tested both direct container access and via an application using the client library.
  
  Inside the containers, supplementary groups are not set correctly. With direct access, a user can change their group access to bypass primary group restrictions, leading to exposure of sensitive data or the ability to execute code; I see the same behavior via the client library.
  
  Please fix the handling of supplementary groups so they are applied correctly in containers and through the client library, and provide guidance to ensure deployments are protected.
