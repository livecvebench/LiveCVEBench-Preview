# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Fedify is a TypeScript library for building federated server applications using ActivityPub and related standards.
  
  I integrated Fedify to provide WebFinger-based account discovery in my service.
  
  I found that crafted WebFinger requests can make my server issue GET requests to arbitrary internal hosts, ports, and URLs, can push it into an infinite loop causing a denial of service, and can be used as a blind SSRF vector despite existing network controls.
  
  Please address this so WebFinger lookups cannot trigger internal requests, loops, or blind SSRF conditions.
