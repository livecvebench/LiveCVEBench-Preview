  This application uses JRuby with the jruby-openssl gem to make secure HTTPS
  connections to external services.

  When making HTTPS connections, the application verifies that the SSL/TLS
  certificate is valid and trusted. However, connections are being accepted even
  when the certificate presented by the server is for a completely different domain
  than the one being connected to.

  For example, when connecting to "api.example.com", the application accepts a
  valid certificate issued for "attacker.com" without any errors. The connection
  succeeds despite the hostname mismatch.

  We expect the application to reject SSL/TLS connections when the certificate's
  hostname does not match the target hostname, similar to how standard Ruby (CRuby)
  handles such connections.

  The issue appears to be in how the SSL context is configured by default. Look at
  the default parameters used when establishing SSL/TLS connections.
