instruction: |-
  rudder-server is part of RudderStack, an open source Customer Data Platform (CDP). Versions of rudder-server prior to 1.3.0-rc.1 are vulnerable to SQL injection. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to the `rudder` role in PostgresSQL having superuser permissions by default. Version 1.3.0-rc.1 contains patches for this issue.
