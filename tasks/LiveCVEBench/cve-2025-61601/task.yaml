  This application is a virtual classroom platform that includes an interactive
  polling feature. Meeting participants can respond to polls created by presenters.

  We've discovered that when users submit responses to a poll, the system accepts
  an unreasonably large array of answer IDs. For example, a user can submit a poll
  response containing thousands or even hundreds of thousands of answer selections.

  When this happens, the backend service becomes unresponsive and may eventually
  crash with memory or timeout errors. The issue affects the GraphQL action handler
  that processes poll vote submissions.

  The expected behavior is that the poll submission handler should validate the
  size of the answer array and reject requests that contain an excessive number
  of selections. A reasonable limit would be around 100 options, since no legitimate
  poll would have more choices than that.

  Please implement proper input validation to prevent oversized array submissions
  from being processed.
