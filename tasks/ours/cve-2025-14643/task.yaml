  This PHP application is a simple attendance record system that allows students to
  log their attendance by entering their student ID. The system checks if the student
  ID exists in the database and records attendance if valid.

  Users are reporting strange behavior with the student verification endpoint. When
  certain special characters are entered in the student ID field, the system returns
  "Success" even though the student ID doesn't exist in the database. For example:

  - Entering "121299" (a valid student ID) correctly returns "Success"
  - Entering "999999" (invalid ID) correctly returns "Error"
  - But entering certain patterns with apostrophes returns "Success" incorrectly

  Additionally, some requests take an unusually long time (several seconds) to
  complete when specific input patterns are used, causing the page to hang.

  The issue appears to be in how the check.php file processes user input before
  querying the database. Please review and fix the input handling to ensure that
  only legitimate student IDs are validated successfully.
