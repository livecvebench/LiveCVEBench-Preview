instruction: |-
  In the Discord bot's Mod module, the massban command does not properly check user hierarchy before executing. Users with moderator privileges can ban members who have higher roles than they should be able to affect when certain conditions are met. The hierarchy check should be enforced consistently regardless of the bot's state.
