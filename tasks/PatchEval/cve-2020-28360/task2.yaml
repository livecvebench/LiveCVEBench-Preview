instruction: |-
  The private IP detection function does not correctly identify all reserved IP address ranges. When checking if an IP address is private, certain reserved address ranges are not being properly filtered. This causes the function to incorrectly classify some reserved IPs as public addresses. The regular expression pattern should cover all standard reserved IP ranges.
