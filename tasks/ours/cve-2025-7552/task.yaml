  Northstar is a quantitative trading platform built with Spring Boot that provides
  trading strategy management, gateway connections, and system logging features.

  Users have reported that certain protected endpoints can be accessed without
  logging in. Specifically, when accessing URLs like `/northstar/log` or
  `/northstar/gateway`, the application correctly returns a 401 Unauthorized error.
  However, users discovered that by modifying the URL in certain ways (using
  special character encodings in the path), they can access these protected
  endpoints without any authentication.

  For example, accessing the logs endpoint directly requires authentication as
  expected, but accessing it through a specially crafted URL allows anyone to
  view the logs without logging in. This happens consistently across different
  protected endpoints under the `/northstar/` path.

  We expect that all protected endpoints should require proper authentication
  regardless of how the URL is formatted or encoded. The authorization check
  in the request interceptor should handle URL variations correctly.
