# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  regclient is a Go client for interacting with Docker and OCI registries, including pulling and working with image manifests.
  
  I used regclient to fetch a manifest pinned by digest from a registry in our pipeline.
  
  I observed that the registry returned a manifest with a different digest than the one pinned, and regclient did not flag or reject the mismatch.
  
  Please fix this so that fetching a pinned manifest fails when the returned digest does not match, preventing undetected tampering.
