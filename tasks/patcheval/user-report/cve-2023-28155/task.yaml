# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  This repository uses the Request package in Node.js to perform outbound HTTP and HTTPS requests to external services.
  
  I added SSRF protections around our request logic, including restricting allowed destinations and checking redirects.
  
  I found that an attacker-controlled server can redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, or HTTPS to HTTP, and the request bypasses our SSRF mitigations.
  
  Please fix this so cross-protocol redirects do not bypass our SSRF protections when using Request.
