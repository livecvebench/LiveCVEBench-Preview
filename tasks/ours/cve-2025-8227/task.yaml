  This application is ChanCMS, a content management system built on Node.js/Express
  with MySQL and Vue3. It includes a web scraping feature that allows administrators
  to collect articles from external websites.

  The content collection endpoint (`/cms/collect/getArticle`) accepts a `parseData`
  parameter that is supposed to be a JSON configuration for HTML cleaning options.
  However, users are reporting that when they submit parsing configurations, the
  system behaves unexpectedly - sometimes executing expressions they didn't intend.

  For example, when sending a request with `parseData` containing JavaScript-like
  syntax such as `return data.toUpperCase();`, the server appears to evaluate and
  execute this as code rather than treating it as configuration data. This allows
  arbitrary JavaScript execution on the server.

  The expected behavior is that `parseData` should only accept valid JSON
  configuration objects (like `{"removeSelectors": "script, style"}`) and reject
  any non-JSON input with an appropriate error message. The system should never
  evaluate user input as executable code.

  Please fix this issue so that the endpoint safely parses `parseData` as JSON
  configuration only, and uses the existing `cleanHtml` utility for HTML processing.
