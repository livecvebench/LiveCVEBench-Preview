instruction: |-
  When serializing XML elements that have been removed from their ancestor nodes, special characters are not properly escaped. This can lead to unexpected changes in the XML structure when the document is serialized and parsed again. The serialization should properly escape special characters regardless of whether elements are attached to the document.
