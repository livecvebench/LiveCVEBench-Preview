  This application is a blog management system with a scheduled task feature that allows
  administrators to configure and execute background jobs.

  When creating or running a scheduled task through the "Monitoring Center -> Scheduled Tasks"
  interface, the system allows specifying an "invoke target" that determines which class and
  method to execute. While this is intended for legitimate task classes like the built-in
  BlogQuartz, the current implementation does not validate which classes can be instantiated.

  This means any fully-qualified class name (e.g., "org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml.load(...)") can be
  used as the invoke target. When such a task is executed, the system will instantiate the
  specified class and invoke its method, which could lead to unintended behavior if a class
  outside the expected task package is used.

  We need to restrict the invoke target to only allow known, safe task classes. The validation
  should occur in the job execution utility before any class instantiation happens.

  Expected behavior: The system should reject requests to execute tasks with invoke targets
  that reference classes outside the allowed list of task classes.
