# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  go-getter is a Go library for retrieving content from URLs and version control systems, including Git.
  
  I used it to update existing Git checkouts as part of our build pipeline.
  
  When the checkout’s Git configuration had been maliciously modified, the update triggered arbitrary code execution.
  
  Please provide a fix to prevent code execution during updates of existing Git repositories, even if their local configuration has been tampered with.
