  This is a Supplier Management System built with PHP and MySQL that provides
  inventory and category management capabilities for administrators, manufacturers,
  and retailers.

  Users have reported a critical issue with the category management feature. When
  adding a new category through the admin panel at "/admin/add_category.php", the
  application does not properly handle special input characters. Specifically:

  1. When category names containing single quotes or other special characters are
     submitted, the application exhibits unpredictable behavior - sometimes failing
     silently, other times causing database errors.

  2. More concerning, certain specially-crafted inputs appear to cause significant
     delays in server response (several seconds), suggesting the database query
     execution is being affected by the input content.

  3. There are concerns that the current database query construction method may
     allow unintended database operations to be executed.

  The category addition functionality should handle all valid category names safely,
  including those with special characters, without affecting database integrity or
  causing unusual delays. The fix should use proper database query practices such
  as prepared statements with parameterized queries.

  To test the application:
  - Access the login page at /Supply_Management_System/index.php
  - Login as admin with credentials: admin / admin123
  - Navigate to Add Category at /admin/add_category.php
  - Submit the category form with various inputs
