  WeGIA is a web application for managing charitable institutions. It includes a
  debug information page (html/configuracao/debug_info.php) that allows administrators
  to switch Git branches for development purposes.

  Users have reported that the branch switching functionality is behaving unexpectedly.
  When certain branch names are submitted through the form, the server experiences
  significant delays or hangs. For example, submitting a branch name containing
  characters like semicolons or ampersands causes the request to take much longer
  than expected (sometimes 5+ seconds) instead of returning an error promptly.

  Additionally, users have noticed that branch names with special characters are
  being accepted without any validation, even though Git branch names typically
  only contain alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, hyphens, and forward
  slashes.

  We expect the application to:
  1. Validate branch names and reject invalid ones with an appropriate error message
  2. Handle all input safely without unexpected delays or side effects
  3. Continue to work correctly for valid branch names like "master", "develop", or
     "feature/new-feature"
