# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  snapd manages the installation and sandboxing of snaps, enforcing permissions with AppArmor.
  
  I installed a snap that uses the 'home' plug on Ubuntu with AppArmor enforcement, where $HOME/bin is on my PATH.
  
  I found the snap could write arbitrary scripts into $HOME/bin, and those scripts were then executed by me outside the snap sandbox via PATH, allowing confinement to be bypassed.
  
  Please fix this so snaps using the 'home' plug cannot place executables in user PATH locations (such as $HOME/bin) and ensure confinement cannot be escaped.
