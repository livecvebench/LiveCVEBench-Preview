instruction: |-
  When extracting tar archives, the symlink protection can be bypassed. If a tar archive contains both a directory and a symlink with the same name, the extraction process may allow files to be written to locations outside the intended extraction directory through the symlink. The extraction should properly handle cases where directories are replaced by symlinks.
