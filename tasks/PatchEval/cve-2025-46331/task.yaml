  OpenFGA is a high-performance and flexible authorization/permission engine built for developers and inspired by Google Zanzibar. OpenFGA v1.8.10 to v1.3.6 (Helm chart <= openfga-0.2.28, docker <= v.1.8.10) are vulnerable to authorization bypass when certain Check and ListObject calls are executed. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.11.
