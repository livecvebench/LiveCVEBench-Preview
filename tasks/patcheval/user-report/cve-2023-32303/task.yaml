# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Planet is software that provides satellite data.
  
  I used Planet’s secret file to store my API authentication on a shared system.
  
  I found that the file is readable by other users on the machine, exposing my Planet API credentials.
  
  Please ensure the secret file is created with permissions that restrict access to only the owning user.
