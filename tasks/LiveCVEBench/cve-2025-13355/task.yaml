  URL Shortify is a WordPress plugin that allows administrators to create and manage
  shortened URLs. It provides features like link creation, group management, and
  click tracking through an admin dashboard.

  Users have reported that when they visit certain URLs with crafted query parameters
  in the admin panel, the page displays malformed content. Specifically, when accessing
  the "Add New Link" page (admin.php?page=us_links&action=new) with certain URL
  parameters containing special characters like quotes or angle brackets, the page
  HTML structure breaks and in some cases unwanted content appears on the page.

  For example, visiting a URL like:
  /wp-admin/admin.php?page=us_links&action=new&form_data[cpt_id]=test"><div>broken&submitted=submitted

  Results in the HTML structure being corrupted with the injected content appearing
  in the page source.

  We expect the plugin to handle URL parameters properly without allowing them to
  affect the page structure. Form data should only be accepted through proper POST
  form submissions, not via URL query parameters.

  The same issue affects the group management page at admin.php?page=us_groups.
