instruction: |-
  This application provides a GitOps continuous delivery platform with webhook
  integration for multiple Git providers including GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket Server.

  When receiving webhook payloads from Bitbucket Server, the application crashes if
  the `repository.links.clone` field contains an unexpected data type. For example,
  if the webhook payload has `"links": {"clone": "some_string"}` instead of the
  expected array format `"links": {"clone": [{"href": "...", "name": "ssh"}]}`,
  the server process terminates abruptly.

  The error observed in logs before crash:
  ```
  panic: interface conversion: interface {} is string, not []interface {}
  ```

  The webhook handler should gracefully handle malformed or unexpected payload
  structures without crashing. When encountering invalid data types in the payload,
  the handler should skip processing that data and continue normally, rather than
  causing a panic.
