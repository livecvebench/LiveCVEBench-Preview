# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the machine learning lifecycle, including experiment tracking, artifacts, and model packaging.
  
  I run the MLflow tracking server and allow users to browse and download run artifacts.
  
  I found that providing a filename with a backslash path traversal pattern like \..\filename lets users read files outside the intended artifact directory.
  
  Please fix the path handling so crafted backslash-based paths cannot escape the allowed directories and only authorized files are accessible.
