# CVE-2025-55741
instruction: |-
  A vulnerability in unopim/unopim versions prior to 0.3.1 allows for unauthorized product deletion due to improper access control (CWE-284) and missing authorization (CWE-862) within the mass-delete endpoint. Specifically, users without the Delete privilege for products are unable to delete individual products via the standard endpoint, as expected. However, these users can bypass intended access controls by issuing requests to the mass-delete endpoint, allowing them to delete products without proper authorization. This vulnerability allows unauthorized product deletion, leading to potential data loss and business disruption.
