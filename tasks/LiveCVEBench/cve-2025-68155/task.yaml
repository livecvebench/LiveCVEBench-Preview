instruction: |-
  This is a Vite application with React Server Components (RSC) support using
  @vitejs/plugin-rsc. It provides source map URL resolution for server component
  debugging during development.

  When querying the `/__vite_rsc_findSourceMapURL` endpoint with a `file://` URL
  in the filename parameter, the application reads and returns the contents of
  files outside the project directory. For example, requesting
  `/__vite_rsc_findSourceMapURL?filename=file:///etc/passwd&environmentName=Server`
  returns the full contents of `/etc/passwd` in the response.

  This endpoint should only return source maps for files within the project's
  allowed scope. Files outside the project directory (like `/etc/passwd`, `.env`
  files in parent directories, or system configuration files) should not be
  accessible through this endpoint.

  The application should respond with a 404 status and empty JSON body when
  a file outside the allowed scope is requested.
