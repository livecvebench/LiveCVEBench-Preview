instruction: |-
  When user input is passed to the path or pathname option of a request, URLs starting with double slashes or containing protocol prefixes can change the actual destination. A path like "//127.0.0.1" is processed as a request to 127.0.0.1 instead of being appended to the origin. The path handling should ensure the origin cannot be overridden by path input.
