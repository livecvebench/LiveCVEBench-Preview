  YesWiki is a PHP-based wiki system that allows collaborative editing and content
  management. Users can embed various content types and reference files within wiki
  pages.

  A user reported that when special characters like < and > are included in page
  content, the rendered HTML output displays incorrectly. The browser appears to
  interpret some user-provided text as markup rather than displaying it as plain text.

  The expected behavior is that user-provided content should be safely rendered
  without being interpreted as HTML markup by the browser.

  Investigate the wiki's content rendering pipeline to identify where user input
  is being output without proper escaping.
