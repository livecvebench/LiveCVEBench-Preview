# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Gradio is an open-source Python library for quickly building web demos and applications around machine learning models, APIs, or arbitrary Python functions.
  
  I configured an ACL to block access to specific files and directories in my Gradio app.
  
  Users can still access those paths by requesting the same path with different letter casing on a case-insensitive system (e.g., macOS or Windows), which exposes sensitive files.
  
  Please fix the path ACL so blocked files and directories remain blocked regardless of how the request capitalizes the path.
