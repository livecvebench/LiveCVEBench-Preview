  Emlog is a PHP-based blog and CMS system. The application provides an admin panel
  where administrators can search for apps, templates, and plugins in the store.

  When using the search functionality in the admin store pages (/admin/store.php),
  user input containing special characters like quotes ("), angle brackets (<, >),
  or ampersands (&) is displayed incorrectly in the search box after submission.
  For example, searching for `test & "example"` shows garbled or broken HTML in
  the input field.

  More critically, certain input patterns cause the page to render improperly,
  with visible HTML tags appearing outside of input fields. This affects the
  search forms on three store pages:
  - All Apps page (/admin/store.php)
  - Templates page (/admin/store.php?action=tpl)
  - Plugins page (/admin/store.php?action=plu)

  Expected behavior: Special characters in search keywords should be safely
  displayed in the search input field without breaking the page layout or
  allowing unintended content rendering.
