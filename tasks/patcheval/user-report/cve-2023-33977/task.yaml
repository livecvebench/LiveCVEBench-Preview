# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Kiwi TCMS is an open-source test management system for manual and automated testing that lets users attach files to test plans, test cases, and related artifacts.
  
  I deployed Kiwi TCMS behind an Nginx reverse proxy and relied on the built-in upload validation and security headers while uploading attachments to test plans and test cases.
  
  I found that some dangerous attachments are still accepted and can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser, and responses from the proxied instance are missing expected security headers, reducing protection.
  
  Please fix the upload validation to reliably block unsafe files and ensure all necessary security headers are consistently delivered, including when Kiwi TCMS is served behind a reverse proxy.
