# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Kubelet is the Kubernetes node agent that manages pods and containers and mounts volumes on each node.
  
  I ran workloads that use gitRepo volumes managed by kubelet.
  
  I found that a repository prepared in a specific way causes commands to run on the node, enabling arbitrary command execution through the gitRepo volume.
  
  Please fix this so gitRepo volumes cannot trigger command execution on the node and are safe to use.
