# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Wings is Pterodactyl’s server control plane for managing servers on host systems.
  
  I provisioned a server managed by Wings and exercised file operations from within that server.
  
  I observed that I can delete files and directories recursively on the host system, and in some cases overwrite host files, despite being confined to a server allocation.
  
  Please fix this so actions from an allocated server cannot modify or remove files or directories on the host outside their allowed scope.
