  This application is Langflow, a visual AI workflow builder that allows users to
  create, test, and deploy AI applications through a graphical interface.

  The `/api/v1/validate/code` endpoint is used to validate Python code snippets
  submitted by users. Currently, this endpoint accepts requests without requiring
  any authentication.

  When sending a POST request to `/api/v1/validate/code` with a JSON body
  containing `{"code": "def example(): pass"}`, the server returns a 200 response
  with validation results, even though no authentication credentials were
  provided.

  According to the application's security model, all code-related endpoints
  should require user authentication to prevent unauthorized access. Other
  similar endpoints in the API correctly require authentication before
  processing requests.

  Please add authentication to the `/api/v1/validate/code` endpoint so that
  unauthenticated requests are rejected with a 401 Unauthorized response.
