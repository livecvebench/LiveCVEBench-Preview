  When sanitizing HTML content, URI attribute values containing character entities are not being properly validated. If a URL contains HTML entities like &amp; or &#x6A;, the sanitizer doesn't decode them before checking the URL scheme. This allows URLs with disallowed schemes to pass through when encoded as character entities.
