# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client for Node.js that handles HTTP requests.
  
  I used undici.request() to call third-party endpoints in our application.
  
  I found that undici.request() forwards Authorization and Proxy-Authorization headers, while fetch() does not, resulting in credentials being sent to external services.
  
  Please update undici.request() so these headers are not forwarded and its behavior matches fetch().
