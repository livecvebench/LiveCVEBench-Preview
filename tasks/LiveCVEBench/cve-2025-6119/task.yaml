instruction: |-
  This application is a 3D asset import library (Assimp) that supports loading
  various 3D model and animation formats, including BVH (Biovision Hierarchical)
  motion capture files.

  When loading certain BVH files with complex nested joint hierarchies, the
  application crashes. The crash occurs specifically when processing files where
  the structure causes many recursive calls during parsing. Users report seeing
  crashes with messages like "heap-use-after-free" when AddressSanitizer is
  enabled, or intermittent segmentation faults without ASAN.

  The issue appears to be in the BVH loader component. When loading a BVH file
  with deeply nested JOINT declarations (e.g., a full-body skeleton with 20+
  joints), the application sometimes crashes during the channel parsing phase.

  We expect the application to handle any valid or malformed BVH file gracefully
  without crashing, either by successfully parsing it or by returning an
  appropriate error message.
