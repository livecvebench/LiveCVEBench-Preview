# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Distribution is a toolkit to pack, ship, store, and deliver container content.
  
  I deployed the registry with token authentication enabled and use JWTs to gate access.
  
  I found that JWTs with a JWK header and no certificate chain are accepted even when signed by an untrusted key, which lets forged tokens perform push/pull operations.
  
  Please fix token authentication to reject these tokens and ensure only properly trusted signatures are accepted.
