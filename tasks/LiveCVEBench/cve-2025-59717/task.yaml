  This application uses the @digitalocean/do-markdownit package to render Markdown
  with extended features like callouts and environment-specific code blocks.

  Users report that the access control for custom callout classes and fence environment
  names is not working correctly. The configuration is set to only allow specific values
  (e.g., "admin" and "info" for callout classes, "production" and "test" for environment
  names), but users are somehow able to use partial names that shouldn't be permitted.

  For example:
  - When allowedClasses is configured with "admin" and "info", users can still create
    callouts with class names like "in", "adm", "fo", or "nf" which should be blocked.
  - When allowedEnvironments is configured with "production" and "test", users can
    use environment names like "pro", "prod", or "est" which should also be blocked.

  The expected behavior is that only exact matches from the allowed list should work.
  Any class or environment name that isn't an exact match should be rejected, causing
  the markup to be escaped or treated as plain text instead of being rendered.

  Please investigate why partial/substring values are being accepted and fix the
  validation logic in both the callout and fence_environment plugins.
