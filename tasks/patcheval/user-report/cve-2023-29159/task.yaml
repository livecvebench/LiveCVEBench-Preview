# CVE-2025-24806
instruction: |-
  Starlette is a Python ASGI framework for creating web services.
  
  I deployed a Starlette-based web service to serve content.
  
  I found that unauthenticated users can view files on the server that should not be exposed via the service.
  
  Please fix this so unauthenticated requests cannot access arbitrary files through the service.
