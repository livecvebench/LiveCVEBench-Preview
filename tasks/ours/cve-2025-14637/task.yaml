  This application is an Online Pet Shop Management System that allows administrators
  to manage products, view orders, and maintain their admin accounts.

  When adding a new product through the "Add Product" page (addcnp.php), users report
  that the application behaves erratically with certain product names. Specifically:

  1. When a product name contains special characters like single quotes ('), the
     product may not be saved correctly or may cause database errors.

  2. When we tested with product names containing certain patterns (e.g.,
     "Test' OR '1'='1"), the database query appears to behave unexpectedly -
     sometimes saving incorrect data or timing out.

  3. The form validation seems to allow any text in the product name field, but
     the backend doesn't handle it safely when inserting into the database.

  We expect product names with special characters to be handled properly and saved
  to the database without causing errors or unexpected query behavior. The product
  addition feature should be robust against any user input.

  The relevant files are located in the /var/www/html/pet1/ directory.
