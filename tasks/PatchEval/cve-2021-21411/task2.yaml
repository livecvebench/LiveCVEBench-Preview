  The GitLab group-based authorization feature is not working correctly. When using the gitlab-group flag to restrict access based on group membership, all authenticated users are being allowed access regardless of their group memberships. Additionally, the configured group names are being added to the forwarded headers for all users. The group membership validation should properly check user group memberships.
